<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="pageiii"></a>[p.iii]</span> PREFACE.</h2>
<p>When a woman, either from choice or through necessity, makes up her mind
to work for a living, and has selected the employment that seems most
suited to her, she probably asks herself such questions as these: "Is
there a good chance to get work? How long will it take me to make myself
competent? Are there many in the business? How much do they earn? How
hard will I have to work? Are there any objections against entering this
employment; if so, what are they?"</p>

<p>To answer, as far as it is possible, these and similar questions is the
object of this little book. Some of the most important avocations,
professions, trades, businesses, in which women are now engaged, have
been selected, and the effort made to enlighten the would-be
woman-worker <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageiv"></a>[p.iv]</span> as to the practical points of interest connected
with each occupation. The information thus given has, in each case, been
gained from the most reliable sources.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1882-3 I contributed to the columns of the New York
<i>Christian Union</i> a series of articles under the title of "Work for
Women." They were written with the aim of furnishing to women useful
information in regard to various industries in which the gentler sex are
successfully seeking employment, and met with considerable favor from
the readers of that excellent journal. Through the courtesy of Rev.
Lyman Abbott and Hamilton W. Mabie, editors of the <i>Christian Union</i>,
the publishers of this book are allowed to use the title of that series.
It should be stated, however, that the chapters in the present book are
made up from new investigations, and that none of them are reproductions
of any of the articles in the series alluded to. <span class="ralign">G. J. M.</span></p>

<h1><span class="pagenum"><a id="page1"></a>[p.1]</span> WORK FOR WOMEN.</h1>
<h2>INDUSTRIAL DESIGNING.</h2>

<p>A great many women have, or think they have, a taste for art. They can
make a pretty sketch, or draw a landscape quite fairly, and so they
think they will "take up" art as a profession. And nearly all of them
fail of success. The trouble seems to be that they lack originality;
they are mere copyists, and too often very poor reproducers of the
things they copy.</p>

<p>One branch of art&mdash;that of industrial designing&mdash;offers golden
opportunities to make an excellent living in a pleasant way, but, before
deciding to enter it, a woman should be very sure indeed that she has
the necessary qualifications to pursue the study successfully; otherwise
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2"></a>[p.2]</span> her time will be wasted, and probably her heart will be so
discouraged that she will be sadly unfitted for any kind of work for a
long time to come.</p>

<p>It is <i>industrial</i> art of which I am speaking. A few introductory words
may be necessary, for the benefit of some persons ignorant in the
matter, to show what women are doing, or rather successfully attempting
to do, in that line at the present time.</p>
<p>Industrial or technical designing means designing for wall-paper, lace,
silk, chintz, calico, oil-cloth, linoleum, book-covers, embroidery,
wood-carving, silver-ware, jewelry, silks, handkerchiefs, upholstery
goods, and carpets of all grades, from ingrains to moquettes. Up to
within a very short period all this work has been done by men,
principally foreigners; but talented and enterprising women saw that
they were able to do the work equally well, and it is only a question of
time when women will entirely monopolize this field of industry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page3"></a>[p.3]</span> It will be seen at once that the woman who is ambitious to become
an industrial designer must have, first of all, originality. She must
have good taste and an eye for color. Drawing must come natural to her.
The mere ability to copy pictures, or make sketches from nature is not
enough. She must be full of ideas, and for some of the work mentioned
(notably carpet designing) she must have what might be called a
combining mind&mdash;that is, the ability to get ideas from several designs,
and by combining them together, make something new. It must be confessed
that this kind of ability is rare. Very few men possess it, and fewer
women. Manufacturers of carpets and wall-papers say that they have to
import nearly all their help of this kind from Europe; they cannot find
in this country the right kind of men to do the work.</p>

<p>But because a woman has not this talent for originating largely
developed, she should not be discouraged from becoming an industrial
designer. If she has even a little talent in that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page4"></a>[p.4]</span> direction she
may find, after taking a few lessons, that the study is very congenial
to her, and that she has more ability than she imagined. The kind of
designing of which I am particularly speaking in this chapter is
designing for carpets, oil-cloths, and wall-paper. That seems to be the
most popular at the present time, though there is a good chance for
skilled workers in the other branches to which allusion was made.</p>
<p>It is surprising what a demand there is for new designs in carpets,
wall-paper, and oil-cloths. One would suppose that a single design would
last for a long time; but such is not the fact. The demand of the public
is continually for novelty; the fashion changes in these matters, just
the same as it does in bonnets and dresses, and each manufacturer is
competing with his neighbor to get something pretty and original. A good
design can always be sold at a good price; an ordinary or a poor design
has no chance at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page5"></a>[p.5]</span> There are two schools in New York where industrial designing is
taught to women. They are both carried on by women, and both present
their claims to the public under very favorable auspices. Some of the
instruction, however, is given by men&mdash;practical workers in the various
branches of art&mdash;who lecture on the special subject with which they are
familiar. Here are some of the subjects of these lectures:
"Conventionalization in Design," "Practical Design as Applied to
Wall-paper," "Principles of Botany" (delivered by a lady), "Historical
Ornament in Design," "Harmony in Color in Design," "Design as Applied to
Carpets," "Geometry in Design," "The Influence of Color in Design,"
"Purity of Design," "Oriental Influence in Design," "Plant Forms: their
Use and Abuse." This last lecture was delivered by a lady. But the pupil
gets most of her learning in the class-room, the lectures being
considered simply as adjunct to the regular system of instruction.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page6"></a>[p.6]</span> In one school the first term begins October 2d, and closes
December 22d. The second term begins January 4th and closes March 30th.
The post-graduate course commences April 2d, and ends May 25th. Those
pupils who have no knowledge of drawing are obliged to enter the
elementary class. Those who enter the advanced classes are obliged to
present specimens of free-hand drawing, such as flowers from nature,
ornamental figures or scrolls. During the year each pupil in the
elementary class must complete nine certificate sheets, of uniform size
(15 x 22 inches), one each of geometrical problems, blackboard and
dictation exercise, enlarged copy in outline, conventionalized flowers
in a geometrical figure, applied designs, outline drawing from objects,
outline drawing from flowers, historical ornament, botanical analysis.
In the flower painting class, three outline drawings, and four paintings
of flowers from nature. In the carpet class, one each of a two-ply
ingrain on the lines, three-ply ingrain on the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page7"></a>[p.7]</span> lines, tapestry
sketch, body-Brussels sketch, moquette sketch, optional sketch (for
either stair-carpet, rug, chair back and seats, hall carpet, or borders,
body-Brussels working design on the lines, tapestry working design on
the lines.)</p>

<p>The terms of tuition in this school per term are: for the elementary
class, $15; the advanced class, $25; the teachers' class, $15. Ten
lessons in wood-carving and designing for book-covers cost $12. Six
lessons in embroidery cost $5, and for a course of instruction in
flower-painting the charge is $15. The materials used in the elementary
class cost from $7 to $10, and for the advanced classes from $10 to $12.
The elementary class studies an hour and a half a day three times a
week; the advanced class the same length of time twice a week.</p>

<p>According to the prospectus of this school, it takes three years to
become thoroughly proficient. One year is spent in the elementary
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page8"></a>[p.8]</span> class, and in obtaining a knowledge of flower-painting and
making simple designs for calico, muslin, stained glass, inlaid woods,
jewelry, etc. The second year is devoted to making advanced designs for
oil-cloth, linoleum, silk, and carpets. The third year is spent in doing
practical work under the supervision of the principal and her
assistants. It would not seem to be necessary for a pupil to return to
the school the third year for this purpose. After her first two years'
instruction she ought to be able to put her knowledge to business use,
and seek to sell her work among the various manufacturers.</p>

<p>In the other school to which I have referred the terms for tuition in
drawing are $12 for a term of three months&mdash;thirty-six lessons. In the
design class the fee is $20. The method of instruction is substantially
the same as in the school first mentioned.</p>

<p>And now comes the interesting question, How much can a woman make in
this profession, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page9"></a>[p.9]</span> after she has become thoroughly qualified? I do
not think she can hope to get a permanent salaried position, at least
just at present. For this profession, albeit a good one, is a new one
for women; it is less than two years since the first school was started.
Men still hold the best positions, and they receive large salaries, from
$1,000 to $4,000 a year. In the present condition of affairs, hedged in
as the female industrial designer is by the masculine doubt of the
employer as to her ability, and the masculine jealousy of the employé
whose work she seeks to do, it would be the best plan for her to do
piece-work at her own home, or office. Her earnings, under this plan,
cannot even be stated approximately. The pay for a good carpet design
would be $20 to $30, and the design can be made in two and a half days.
Wall-paper designs bring $10 to $15; an oil-cloth sketch, $8 or $10&mdash;the
technicalities to be mastered in this latter branch are not so great as
in the others.</p>

<hr class="chap">
<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page10"></a>[p.10]</span> SHORT-HAND WRITING.</h2>

<p>The custom of employing women as amanuenses has grown very largely of
late years. It is said on good authority that, fifteen years ago, there
were but five females in the city of New York who made their living by
writing short-hand; at the present time there are, as nearly as can be
estimated, between one hundred and fifty and two hundred.</p>

<p>"Which is the best system of short-hand?" is generally the first
question asked by the person desirous of entering this profession. And
that is a very difficult question to answer, and many of the answers
that have been given to it have been very far from honest.</p>

<p>In the first place, it must be stated that there are about a score of
"systems" of short-hand <span class="pagenum"><a id="page11"></a>[p.11]</span> before the public, each of which has
its defenders and advocates. Each is highly recommended in commendatory
letters from this or that distinguished court or newspaper reporter.
Each can show, and does show, first-class notices from prominent daily
and weekly papers, and each has a circle of followers who loudly
proclaim that the particular system they follow is not only the best in
existence, but really the only one worth learning. In the search after
short-hand truth, it is but natural that the would-be learner gets
bewildered, and asks, "What shall I do?"</p>

<p>The system of short-hand practised by the vast majority of writers, both
in this country and in England, is phonography, invented by Isaac
Pitman, of Bath, England, in 1837. That system is based on an alphabet
representing the sounds of the language, instead of the ordinary
alphabet we use in spelling words. Since 1837 there have been many
phonographic text-books written by as many different authors, and each
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page12"></a>[p.12]</span> author has added a hook here or a circle there, lengthened this
stroke, or made that one heavier; and that accounts for the variety of
"systems." The fact is, they are all based on the original phonography
of Isaac Pitman, who himself, by the way, was the first to set the
example of making changes and "improvements." For all <i>practical</i>
purposes phonography is no better now than it was thirty years ago. I
dwell upon this point, for I know "the best system" has been a sad
stumbling-block to many young people who were naturally anxious to start
on the right road.</p>

<p>Which system, then, is the best? Answer: any system will answer the
purpose of the woman who desires to become simply a phonographic
amanuensis. And it is only of that branch of work of which I write, for
though there are a few female court reporters in the country, the number
is so small and the positions so exceptional in many respects that it is
not worth while to speak of woman's employment in that direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page13"></a>[p.13]</span> Let not the student, then, waste any time in listening to or
reading arguments in favor of the various systems, but go to a bookstore
and get some one of the various manuals on the subject, and begin to
study. These books cost from fifty cents to a dollar and a quarter each.</p>

<p>A teacher is not really necessary, but will prove a help, provided he
has a practical knowledge of the art. The trouble is, however, that many
of the so-called teachers of phonography have never done any actual
reporting in their lives, and their advice and suggestions are not of
much value. The best way for the pupil would be to get the assistance of
some man engaged in actual reporting. One lesson from such a person
would be worth a dozen from some of the teachers who advertise to teach
short-hand, or who are connected with the various colleges. The price
for such service cannot be accurately stated. Short-hand schools and
colleges have "courses" of one hundred and twenty lessons, charging $75
for the same. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page14"></a>[p.14]</span> Students can and do learn at these schools, but
the cheaper and more sensible way for the student learner to do would be
to get the help of a teacher, as I have suggested, and then only as it
was needed. The text-books I have mentioned are very plain, and a
teacher really cannot do much to make them plainer. In six months' time,
if the pupil is diligent, she should be able to write eighty words a
minute, and enter upon actual work, when, with practice, her speed will
gradually increase. If she can reach a speed of one hundred and twenty
words a minute, she will be as good as the average; if she can reach one
hundred and fifty words a minute, she will do what few women ever
accomplish.</p>

<p>She need have no fear about getting a position, if she has made herself
competent. The demand for good workers in this profession is constant
and increasing. Out of several large classes taught by a lady teacher in
New York not one pupil failed, when qualified, to secure <span class="pagenum"><a id="page15"></a>[p.15]</span> a
position. A gentleman connected with a large corporation, who employs
two lady amanuenses, and obtains positions for others, says that he
could secure situations for two or three a week.</p>

<p>It should be added, however, that a knowledge of working on the
type-writer should accompany the ability to write phonography. This
instrument has come into such general use that no detailed description
of it is here required. Briefly, it may be said that it is an instrument
to print letters and documents with despatch, and it is worked with keys
like a piano. To learn this art of type-writing requires but a very
short time, and there are schools or offices in most of the large cities
where it is taught.</p>

<p>A lady can learn phonography as young as sixteen, or at the mature age
of thirty-five; but it is almost needless to say that the art can be
mastered much easier at the former than the latter age. At one of the
schools in New York <span class="pagenum"><a id="page16"></a>[p.16]</span> where it is taught free to women no pupils
are received under the age of eighteen. It is a study that requires
considerable application, a good memory, nimble fingers, and quick
apprehension. There are some people (and this remark applies to both
sexes) who would never be able to learn enough short-hand to be of any
practical service. But the study is nothing like as difficult as it has
often been represented to be. Every thing depends on the student. If she
makes haste slowly, and learns even a little thoroughly every day, she
will soon find herself mastering the theoretical part of the art, and if
she practises constantly, in season and out of season, what she has
properly learned, the secret of short-hand success is hers. The
necessity of practice cannot be overrated. Hence it is that a teacher is
ordinarily of little use. The exercises in the latest manuals on this
subject are very well arranged, and it would seem that the art could not
be presented in a plainer way than it is at present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page17"></a>[p.17]</span> The pay of a lady amanuensis at the start is seldom more than $8
a week. It is not to be supposed that she is fully competent when she
starts at that rate; that is to say, she will not be able to write very
rapidly, and she will be liable to make mistakes in transcribing her
notes. The actual practical experience which she will get in her first
situation will very soon serve to correct these faults. It might, at
first thought, be supposed that few persons would desire to employ
inferior help of this kind; but such is not the fact. Editors, lawyers,
occasionally doctors, and some classes of business men who are obliged
to make rough drafts of papers which go at once to the printer, are
often glad of such help. Their short-hand writer can write fast enough
to save some of their time, at a moderate charge, and it is immaterial
as to the appearance of the "copy" sent to the printer, so long as it
can be plainly read by him. But of course the lady will soar higher than
a salary of $8 a week, and just so soon as she has become <span class="pagenum"><a id="page18"></a>[p.18]</span> more
expert, she will be able to obtain a position requiring greater speed in
taking notes and more accuracy in writing them out. Her salary will then
be $10 or $12 a week, and finally $15 a week. It is not likely she will
earn more than $18 a week, though mention is made of some ladies who are
making $20 or $25 a week, but the situations are exceptional, and, it
may be added, the ladies are exceptional ladies. They have some peculiar
business ability aside from being able to write short-hand. The employer
of one, for instance, can merely indicate by two or three words the kind
of letter he wants written to a certain correspondent, and the lady
clerk, having simply received the idea, will write a satisfactory
letter. If a woman could possess herself of a thorough knowledge of
phonography, be able to work rapidly on the type-writer, and have a fair
knowledge of bookkeeping, she could be certain of obtaining a good
position at an extra large salary, say $1,500 a year; but there is no
doubt that she would have to work hard for the money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page19"></a>[p.19]</span> The hours of work in most all offices are from nine in the
morning until five in the afternoon. The employment is not more arduous
than any other sedentary occupation. In large offices an amanuensis will
receive from thirty to sixty full-page letters in a day and transcribe
them on the type-writer. She could not do so much work without the aid
of that instrument.</p>

<p>It is sometimes the case that a woman can take dictation work for
professional people who only occasionally need such assistance, and be
paid for it by the "job." In such a case the rate of pay for taking and
transcribing the notes will range from six to twenty cents per hundred
words, depending partly on the class of work, but more particularly on
the liberality of the employer.</p>

<hr class="chap">
<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page20"></a>[p.20]</span> TELEGRAPHY.</h2>

<p>There is one thing favorable to young women who want to become telegraph
operators: the qualifications required for success in this line of
business are very simple. An ordinary common school education, with a
special ability to spell well, and to write plainly and more or less
rapidly, is all that is required in a pupil before commencing to learn
this art. This may account for the large number of young ladies who, of
late years, have sought employment in this field of labor. Another
thing, it is office work, with just enough bustle and activity about it
to keep it from being dull, with the occasional chance, in times of
public excitement, of its being exceptionally interesting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page21"></a>[p.21]</span> In the city of New York there are, at the present time, about
two hundred ladies engaged in this occupation. They are nearly all
employed by the Western Union Telegraph Company, three fourths of the
number being employed at the main office of the company. Here and there
a lady may be found employed in a broker's office, a position, by the
way, which is considered exceptionally good, the pay being generous,
with the sure chance of the employé receiving a present at the Christmas
holiday-time. But the great majority of women are employed by the
companies, in hotels, in the smaller stations situated throughout the
city, and throughout the country in the offices located in various
villages and towns.</p>

<p>Instruction in telegraphy has become a special feature in about forty
colleges in different parts of the Union, and in several special
schools, among which the New York Cooper Union School of Telegraphy is
preëminent. Instruction in this last institution is free, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page22"></a>[p.22]</span> Western Union Telegraph Company is so far interested in the
success of the school, that when operators are needed, graduates of the
Cooper Union are preferred over anybody else. The school is always
crowded; it is difficult to gain admission, and situations are not
provided by the company alluded to for all the graduates. Last year
(1882) one hundred and sixty applied at the regular examination of the
school and passed, but they could not be admitted to the class for want
of room. The school admitted sixty pupils during the year. The number
receiving certificates was twenty-eight. Some time since the Kansas
State Agricultural College added telegraphy as a branch of industrial
education, using Pope's "Hand-book of the Telegraph" as a text-book.</p>

<p>Women can learn to become telegraph operators at almost any age. Young
girls of fifteen have successfully studied the art, and women as old as
forty have also learned it. But the age which is recommended by good
judges <span class="pagenum"><a id="page23"></a>[p.23]</span> as being the best, is not younger than eighteen, nor
older than twenty-five.</p>

<p>The time it takes to learn to become an operator depends, of course, on
the aptness of the pupil, her general intelligence, and previous
education. Some learn very readily, others after months of study never
become sufficiently proficient to take positions.</p>

<p>The course of instruction, in most of the institutions where telegraphy
is taught, covers a period of six months. It is said, on good authority,
that practising four or five hours a day for a period of six months,
will enable a young woman to master the art. Probably telegraphy is, in
this respect, very much like phonography&mdash;a person may learn the
principles of the latter science in a comparatively short space of time,
but to avail himself really of its advantages, a great deal of practice
is required. The principles of telegraphy are far simpler than those of
phonography, but the necessity for practice is equally important.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page24"></a>[p.24]</span> Young girls learn easier than women over the age of thirty, and
yet there are several instances of women past the age of forty, who have
quickly qualified themselves to become operators.</p>

<p>The salary of lady telegraphers ranges from $25 to $65 per month. In the
office of the Western Union Telegraph Company they commence with a
salary of $25 per month; the highest wages paid being $60 a month,
unless in some special cases, where they take full charge of important
offices, when they are given $75 a month.</p>

<p>What is called a "good" position may be either in the city or the
country. In fact, the term good, used in this connection, is a purely
relative term. For instance, the salary may be larger in a city, but the
expense of living will be greater, and the work more arduous than it
will be in some small country town, where the wages will be lower. But,
as a rule, the positions in the city seem to be preferred, probably
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page25"></a>[p.25]</span> on the general principle that most young people prefer the
excitement and gayety of metropolitan life to the more quiet and
healthful enjoyments of country towns. During the summer months
positions at the various watering-places are particularly sought after,
the pay of the operator being $30 a month and her board. In the large
city hotels, where business is quite brisk and important, the salary is
from $40 to $50 a month. Operators in the country towns and villages
receive from $30 to $40 a month. But, as was stated above, the brokers'
offices supply the positions most sought after by telegraph operators.
There are very few of these positions. The salary paid an operator in
such a situation is from $75 to $90 a month. The hours of work are
light, being from 9.30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> to 3 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> A woman, however, to hold a
position of this kind must be thoroughly competent, and not only rapid,
but accurate in her work. She must, too, be a woman in whom the utmost
confidence can be placed, and possessed of that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page26"></a>[p.26]</span> rare womanly
gift&mdash;the ability to keep a secret; for she is, in reality, a sort of
confidential clerk.</p>

<p>A gentleman occupying a high position in one of the leading telegraph
companies in New York says, that telegraphy is a good occupation for a
young woman, and, provided she has no talent to do any thing better, it
will furnish her a reasonably pleasant, profitable, and sure means of
employment. But the opportunities of eventually getting a large salary,
or of obtaining an enviable position, do not exist in this field of
work. Women, he says, do not make good managers. They do not seem to
possess the ability, so common even with many ordinary men, of grasping
the varied details of a large business, and conducting it with system
and regularity. In the company alluded to, there are ladies who have
been employed for the last twenty years, but they are receiving no more
pay now than they received ten years ago, and ten years from now their
salary will be no higher than it is at the present time, if, indeed, it
is as much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page27"></a>[p.27]</span> It might be thought by some, that from the comparative ease with
which this art is acquired, many might take it up as a temporary means
of subsistence, and leave it, either for some better employment, or to
assume matrimonial relations. But this is not the fact. The occupation
seems to be one in which few die, and none resign. It should be added,
however, that with the growing use of the telegraph by private
individuals, and the starting of new telegraph companies, good operators
may be reasonably sure of obtaining positions.</p>

<p>Telegraphy is generally learned at some business college, or some school
which makes a specialty of teaching it. The lady who desires to become
an operator should be very careful in making her selection among
institutions of this kind. The Cooper Institute School is not included
in this remark, but attention is called to the many firms throughout the
country, who advertise largely in the weekly papers, to teach telegraphy
in an astonishingly short space of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page28"></a>[p.28]</span> time, and, it may be added,
at astonishingly high rates of tuition. Some of these schools are good,
but many of them cannot be recommended. Before entering any one of them,
the would-be pupil should get the honest advice of some man or woman who
is engaged in the business, and who knows something of the character of
the institution she proposes to enter.</p>

<hr class="chap">
<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page29"></a>[p.29]</span> FEATHER CURLING.</h2>

<p>Fashion has, of late years, made feather curling a good trade for women,
and fashion, at almost any moment, may make it a very poor business. For
the last thirty years feathers have been used every year, but, until
within a very short time, their use has been confined to the fall and
winter season. During the past four or five years they have been in
great demand during the spring and early summer, taking the place of
flowers for ornamental purposes. As a consequence, the occupation of
feather curling has offered unusual good opportunities for girls and
women to earn a living,&mdash;that is to say, as female workers are paid in
the trades.</p>

<p>There are several processes used in preparing <span class="pagenum"><a id="page30"></a>[p.30]</span> the feathers
before they are ready for sale. Some of this work is done by men, but
the larger part of it is done by girls and women. When the feathers
arrive from abroad, they are of a dull brown color, and the first
process consists in washing them thoroughly with a peculiar kind of
chemical soap. Then they are wrung through an ordinary clothes-wringer,
and tied on to lines and hung out in the hot sun to dry, or put in a
drying room if the weather is not favorable. The work of washing and
wringing is done by men; the tying on to the lines by little girls.
After this men put them in big vats where they are dyed, black, blue,
red, yellow, or any other color that may be desired, and again dried.
Then comes the work of the women, who first scrape the rib of the
feather to make it soft and pliant. This is done with a piece of glass.
Then they are curled with a blunt knife. After this they are packed in
boxes and are ready to go from the wholesaler to the jobber, from the
jobber to the retailer, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page31"></a>[p.31]</span> and from the retailer pass to the
purchasers whose hats they are meant to adorn.</p>

<p>Except in rare cases, the people employed at this business are paid by
the piece, and all ages are represented in the different branches of the
industry. There are girls as young as fourteen, and women as old as
forty. The little girls tie the feathers on to the lines, and make from
$2 to $5 a week. The work of preparing and curling the feathers pays the
best, and women who devote themselves to this branch make from $10 to
$40 a week. This last sum is large pay; but it must be stated that those
who make it do so in the busiest season, and they work hard, not only
during the day, but at night, or, may be, they have some one at their
homes to whom a portion of the work is sent from the shop, and in that
way they are assisted to receive such large pay. Nevertheless, if a
woman thoroughly understands the trade, she can always be sure of making
good wages. Some exceptionally proficient women will average $30 a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page32"></a>[p.32]</span> week the year round. Take a hundred expert workers, and each of
them will average $15 to $20 a week during the twelve months. The little
girls never earn very much, because the work they can do is limited to
"stringing" the feathers, which is the technical term for tying the
feathers on a line.</p>

<p>When a girl enters the establishment, she generally works the first two
weeks for nothing, then the superintendent is able to see what she can
do, and she makes $2, $3, or $4 a week, as the case may be; in six or
eight months she ought to be quite expert at the business. To be
successful she must have good taste. She should be able to "lay" the
feather out nicely, so that it will have a graceful appearance when it
is finished. And then she must have good judgment in putting the
feathers together, for it may not be known, but it is the fact, that the
plume which appears on the hat to be a single feather is made up of a
number of small pieces; this good judgment, then, consists, as one
manufacturer <span class="pagenum"><a id="page33"></a>[p.33]</span> frankly stated, in not being wasteful in
selecting,&mdash;in short, in being careful not to pick out too many good
pieces. Though there are a great number of girls in this business, there
are very few who possess all these qualifications. That class of help is
of course a great saving to the employer, and consequently is always
sure of employment. One man said that on account of high rent alone he
wanted to hire all such women. "We have to economize our room," he
remarked, "and one such woman would be worth to us half a dozen poor
workers, who would take up just six times as much space and waste a lot
of material in the bargain. Such expert workers will make three or four
times as much as other women, doing the same kind of work."</p>

<p>The trade is a healthy one, or, to speak more accurately, there are no
special features about it to make it unhealthy. Probably the worst
feature about it is the crowding together of so many girls and women in
one large room. They <span class="pagenum"><a id="page34"></a>[p.34]</span> sit on benches, or stools, without backs,
working at a long, low table that runs the length of the apartment. On
damp days the windows have to be shut, making the atmosphere of the
place close and unwholesome. But the rooms are generally large, with
high ceilings. Five hundred girls are employed in the largest
establishment of the kind in New York. The nominal hours of work are
from eight in the morning until six in the evening, though very often,
in the busy season, the girls are required to work at night as late as
half-past seven or eight o'clock.</p>

<p>There are a few women in New York who profess to teach feather curling;
I say "profess," for I have it on good authority that some of them have
no practical knowledge of the business, and aim only at securing a
generous tuition-fee from the pupil. Now and then, however, a teacher
can be found who is able to impart the necessary knowledge. It has been
charged by women that those who learn privately <span class="pagenum"><a id="page35"></a>[p.35]</span> in this way are
not able to secure good positions in any of the feather curling
establishments, the allegation being that the proprietors of the same
have formed a "ring" to exclude such help. From such investigation as I
have made in regard to this matter, I do not believe that this statement
is correct. Doubtless many such pupils, after working for a short time
in such establishments, have been discharged, but I think the real
reason has been that they were not competent to do the work. And it can
readily be imagined that the facilities for learning a trade like this
would be far better in a large house, where several hundred girls were
employed, or even fifty or seventy-five girls, than they would be in a
class of half a dozen pupils, who had probably between them about as
many feathers upon which to work. It would be much pleasanter to learn
the trade from a teacher; but there are many practical objections
against the feasibility of so doing. If the girl has not worked herself
up from the very foot of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page36"></a>[p.36]</span> the business, and does not have a
knowledge of its preparatory stages, she will be likely to find that if
a feather has been misplaced, or is out of order in any way, she could
not put it in proper shape as well as one who had commenced at the
beginning of the business.</p>

<p>Rather than have any girl or woman hastily decide to learn this trade, I
will, at the risk of repetition, briefly recapitulate: the earnings are
good if you are thoroughly competent; and this may be said to be true of
the future, although there is a prospect, probably a very strong
prospect, that feathers may not be in such demand as they have been, and
as they are now. You will have to work hard to make good pay. The work
is tolerably cleanly, but your associates, if you are particularly nice
in your ideas of companionship, may not always please you. If you are
competent you may be able to take work home, but the facilities for
doing it, and the want of that spirit of competition which prevails, to
a great extent, in a large work-room, may not enable you to do so much
work.</p>

<hr class="chap">
<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page37"></a>[p.37]</span> PHOTOGRAPHY.</h2>

<p>It is a little singular that in a great city like New York, there should
be but one lady photographer, while in the western part of our country
there are quite a number. The photographers I speak of do all the work
of making a picture,&mdash;posing the sitter, preparing the chemicals, and
operating the camera. One reason why there are so few ladies in this
business is the fact, that up to within a short time it has been a very
disagreeable occupation on account of the nature of some of the
chemicals that were used&mdash;they would soil the hands very easily, and the
stains could not be removed. But recent improvements in the art have
removed this objection, and prominent male photographers predict that it
will not be long before <span class="pagenum"><a id="page38"></a>[p.38]</span> their business will be largely carried
on by women.</p>

<p>A contributor to a London magazine, writing some years ago, on the
subject of the employment of women in photography, said: "I have
pleasure in bearing testimony to the fact, that in photography there is
room for a larger amount of female labor; that it is a field exactly
suited to even the conventional notions of woman's capacity; and
further, that it is a field unsurrounded with traditional rules, with
apprenticeship, and with vested rights, and it is one in which there is
no sexual hostility to their employment." These remarks may, with
perfect safety and propriety, be applied to photography in this country.</p>

<p>There are several branches of the art in which women and girls have
always been engaged, viz., the mounting of photographs, the retouching
of negatives, and the coloring of photographs.</p>

<p>The mounting of photographs is apparently a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page39"></a>[p.39]</span> very simple kind of
work, consisting simply in trimming the photograph and pasting it upon
the card-board. But, simple though it seems, it requires great neatness
and considerable skill, if the work is to be done fast, and rapidity of
execution is a prerequisite to employment in nearly all the large
galleries. As an illustration that it is not a very simple
accomplishment, it may be mentioned that out of forty young ladies who
came to work on trial for a prominent photographer, he could find only
nine who were suitable to fill positions. The pay for this work is not
very munificent, ranging from $6 to $10 per week.</p>

<p>The retouching, or taking out the marks or spots on negatives, is a much
more difficult branch of work. The pay, however, does not seem to be as
large as it should be, considering the amount of skill required. Young
women receive from $8 to $12 a week. A man doing the same kind of work,
and working the same number of hours, would be paid $16 a week. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page40"></a>[p.40]</span>
There have been cases where ladies have received larger salaries than
the sums just mentioned, but such instances are rare.</p>

<p>The coloring of photographs is the most important, or rather the highest
paid, of the three branches of work that have been mentioned. It is said
that to be successful at this calling one must have some taste for
drawing, and what is commonly called a good eye for color. Very few
photographers employ colorists on a salary, for the reason that they do
not have enough work to keep them constantly employed. There are
probably but eight or ten galleries in New York where colorists are
employed all the year round. The truth is, that it is not alone
necessary to be a good colorist&mdash;one must be very good; and if very
good, she can have her studio and take work from the galleries as well
as from private parties. Photograph coloring has come to be considered
as important as portraiture. Another qualification for success in the
work, therefore, should be the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page41"></a>[p.41]</span> rare ability not only to
preserve, but sometimes to make, a likeness.</p>

<p>There is one branch of the picture-making business that has grown to
large proportions within the past fifteen years; it is what is called
the "copying" business. There are many establishments in various cities
of the Union that constantly advertise for agents to collect pictures.
The agent goes through the rural districts, visiting each dwelling, and
inquiring of the inmates if there are any old pictures of living or
deceased friends that they would like to have copied, enlarged, and
colored. In nearly every farm-house there are such pictures&mdash;old
daguerreotypes of long-lost aunts, uncles, and grandfathers,
"old-fashioned photographs" of mother, together with newer photographs
of the living taken by the perambulating picture-taker, and taken so
badly with the use of bad chemicals that they are fast fading away. Out
of this motley group the family will be pretty sure to select one or two
pictures which they <span class="pagenum"><a id="page42"></a>[p.42]</span> will deem it worth their while to have
copied and enlarged.</p>

<p>When the agent has collected a sufficient number of pictures in this
way, he sends them by express to the home office, where the work is
done. Some years ago I chanced to know a gentleman who was in this
business; in fact, he claimed to have originated it, and, as he was a
shrewd, smart Yankee, born and brought up in the State of New Hampshire,
I never had the temerity to question his statement. He had a good-sized
brick building in a pleasant little New England city, and employed a
countless number of agents, who travelled in all parts of the country,
and, if I remember right, he had nearly a score of ladies, whose
business it was to color the pictures and to touch some of them up into
something resembling life, after they had been copied and enlarged. I
use these statements with due deliberation, and say that the effort was
made to give them the appearance of something resembling life, for often
they <span class="pagenum"><a id="page43"></a>[p.43]</span> looked like mere blurs. Here and there a nose would be
gone, or an eye would be missing, the lower part of the face would be
entirely absent, but would be counterbalanced, or, rather, overbalanced,
by a heavy head of straight, black hair. These, of course, were very bad
specimens, but they came to the office in the regular course of
business, and had, to use the Yankee expression of the proprietor, to be
"fixed up." These worst specimens were given to a middle-aged single
lady, who really had a genius for making something out of nothing,&mdash;at
least in the matter of pictures. It should be mentioned, however, that
the worst of them were generally accompanied with some written
description of the subject. But we may well believe that such crude data
were of but little service to the artist. The salaries of these
colorists were from $13 to $25 per week. The lady I have just mentioned
received the latter sum, and often made a few more dollars weekly by
doing extra work. At present, she and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page44"></a>[p.44]</span> another lady from the
same establishment, conduct an art school in a city near New York, and
are very prosperous.</p>

<p>There are now opportunities for doing this same kind of work, but there
is not so much of it to do,&mdash;thousands of "active" agents having very
thoroughly worked in the best districts of the country. Still, there is
something to do, and the salaries paid, though not so high as I have
mentioned, are fair.</p>

<p>As I have written above, few photographers in New York employ a colorist
on a regular salary. The largest sum paid to a woman is $25 a week, and
that is given by probably the most prominent photographer in the city.
Others receive from $20 down to $12 a week. But there are quite a number
of ladies who have studios, and who work on their own account, among
them a firm of two sisters, who employ a dozen young women as
assistants. Without a doubt, this plan, provided the woman is competent
in the art, and has good business <span class="pagenum"><a id="page45"></a>[p.45]</span> qualifications, is the best
and most lucrative course to pursue.</p>

<p>There has been lately introduced a new process of coloring pictures for
which very strong claims are made. It is said that the "secret" can be
learned in one lesson; the cost of the instruction is but $5. The method
consists in the application of water colors to any kind of picture on
paper. Some photographers say there is nothing new in the method, and
that the pictures will not stand the light of the sun; others claim that
it is a good process, and say that the pictures are both brilliant and
effective. The teacher of the art asserts that he can, in half a day,
paint a picture, and give all the necessary effects. With the usual
method, he says, a colorist would require two days and a half. The
process has not yet been introduced among photographers, but several
ladies are soliciting work at private houses, receiving, it is said, $4
and $5 for painting a panel picture, and making a good living at the
work. For <span class="pagenum"><a id="page46"></a>[p.46]</span> obvious reasons I do not enter into the particulars
of this method, or even mention the name by which it is known. That,
however, can easily be learned from almost any photographer, and the
searcher for information can then satisfy herself as to whether the
business is worth a trial.</p>

<hr class="chap">
<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page47"></a>[p.47]</span> PROFESSIONAL NURSING.</h2>

<p>It may not be known to many that, of late years, nursing has come to be
a regular profession. Women are trained to become nurses by going
through a regular course of study in what are called training schools,
and they receive on their graduation a diploma signed by an Examining
Board and a Committee of a Board of Managers. For some women this is an
excellent occupation. The work is rather hard, but the pay is
exceptionally good.</p>

<p>At the present time there are seventeen of these training schools in the
United States. There is one in each of the following cities: New Haven
(Conn.), Chicago, New Orleans, St. Louis, Syracuse (N. Y.), Washington
(D. C.), Burlington (Vt.), and there are three in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page48"></a>[p.48]</span> Boston, two
in Brooklyn (N. Y.), three in New York City, and two in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>In order to gain admission to any of these institutions certain
conditions of admission have to be complied with. First of all, the
woman must have good health, she must be unmarried or a widow, she must
furnish satisfactory references as to moral character, and have a fair
common-school education. All these are essential prerequisites. Her age
must not be under twenty or over forty-five. In the Boston schools the
rule is between twenty-one and thirty-five; in Brooklyn, twenty-one to
forty; in New York City, twenty-five to thirty-five; in Philadelphia,
twenty-one to forty-five, and in Washington City, the same as it is in
Brooklyn.</p>

<p>Aside from these qualifications, the woman who would enter upon this
employment must have considerable "nerve," for she will be obliged to
witness some very painful sights, and often be called upon to render
assistance in some very dangerous surgical operations. And <span class="pagenum"><a id="page49"></a>[p.49]</span> yet,
at the same time, while possessing the necessary amount of self-control
to go through her duties properly, she must be possessed of that
gentleness, forbearance, and good temper, without which the most
scientific nursing will be of little avail. She may shudder at the first
operation in the hospital, even faint, but that is no sign that she will
not be able to overcome her want of self-control. Some of the best
surgeons have confessed to the same weakness at the beginning of their
professional experience. The nurse will soon get used to seeing such
unpleasant sights, and, as it was the case with the grave-digger in
Hamlet, custom will make her business "a property of easiness." She,
too, will learn that "the hand of little employment hath the daintier
sense."</p>

<p>The pupil, having made her application to the superintendent of the
school, is required to answer, in writing, certain questions; to give
her name; to state whether she is single or married; to give her present
occupation; her <span class="pagenum"><a id="page50"></a>[p.50]</span> age last birthday, and date and place of birth;
her height and weight; to state where educated; to tell whether she is
strong and healthy, and has always been so; whether her sight and
hearing are good; whether she has any physical defects, or any tendency
to pulmonary complaint; if she is a widow, to state if she has any
children, their number, ages, and how they are provided for; to tell
where she was last employed, and how long she was employed, and to give
the names of two persons as references, one of whom must be her last
employer, if she has been engaged in any occupation. And then she signs
her name to the statement, declaring it to be correct.</p>

<p>If the answers are satisfactory, and there is a vacancy in the school,
she goes on trial for a month, and if, at the end of that time, she
decides that she likes the position, and the superintendent finds she is
able to fulfil the duties properly, she is engaged. For this "trial"
month she receives no pay, but gets her board and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page51"></a>[p.51]</span> lodging free
of expense. Having been accepted as a pupil, she signs articles of
agreement to remain two years and obey the rules of the school and
hospital. All the schools are connected with some hospital; they are not
always in the same building, but in the immediate vicinity. The pupils
reside in the Home, or school, and in the large schools&mdash;the one
connected with Bellevue Hospital, for instance&mdash;there are two sets of
nurses, one set doing day duty, and the other going on at night. The day
nurses are on duty from 8 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> to 8 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, with an hour off for dinner,
and some additional time for exercise or rest. They have one afternoon
during the week, half of Sunday, and a two weeks' vacation during the
summer. If sick, they are cared for gratuitously.</p>

<p>The course of instruction covers two years, when the pupil, after
passing a satisfactory examination, graduates and receives a diploma.
Then she chooses her own field of labor.</p>

<p>In one of the large New York schools the course of instruction includes:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page52"></a>[p.52]</span> 1. The dressing of blisters, burns, sores, and wounds; the
application of fomentations, poultices, cups, and leeches.</p>

<p>2. The administration of enemas, and use of catheter.</p>

<p>3. The management of appliances for uterine complaints.</p>

<p>4. The best method of friction to the body and extremities.</p>

<p>5. The management of helpless patients; making beds; moving, changing,
giving baths in bed; preventing and dressing bed-sores; and managing
positions.</p>

<p>6. Bandaging, making bandages and rollers, lining of splints.</p>

<p>7. The preparing, cooking, and serving of delicacies for the sick.</p>

<p>They are also given instruction in the best practical methods of
supplying fresh air, warming and ventilating sick-rooms in a proper
manner, and are taught to take care of rooms and wards; to keep all
utensils perfectly clean <span class="pagenum"><a id="page53"></a>[p.53]</span> and disinfected; to make accurate
observations and reports to the physician of the state of the
secretions, expectoration, pulse, skin, appetite, temperature of the
body, intelligence&mdash;as delirium or stupor,&mdash;breathing, sleep, condition
of wounds, eruptions, formation of matter, effect of diet, or of
stimulants, or of medicines; and to learn the management of
convalescents.</p>

<p>This teaching is given by physicians, some of whom are connected with
the hospital, while others, often prominent men, occasionally give
lectures. The superintendent, assistant superintendent, and head nurses
also give practical directions to the pupils as to the management of the
sick.</p>

<p>Each school has its favorite text-book on nursing. One of the most
popular works is the "New Haven Hand-book of Nursing," which is used in
the East and West, and in New York. In the New York schools the
"Bellevue Manual" is also used. Among the other text-books studied in
the different schools <span class="pagenum"><a id="page54"></a>[p.54]</span> throughout the country are "Anatomy and
Physiology," "Domville's Manual," "Woolsey's Hand-book for Hospital
Visitors," "Williams and Fisher's Hints to Hospital Nurses," "Lee's
Hand-book for Hospital Sisters," "Cutter's Anatomy and Physiology,"
"Putnam's Manual," "Huxley's Physiology," "Smith on Nursing," "Frankel's
Manual," "West on Children," "Notes on Nursing," by Florence
Nightingale, "Draper's Anatomy, Physiology, and Hygiene," "Bartholow's
Materia Medica," and "Miss Veitch's Hand-book for Nursing." The Boston
and New York schools use the largest number of text-books, averaging
six. At one of the schools in Philadelphia, but one book is used; in
Connecticut, Chicago, and Washington two text-books are studied.</p>

<p>While the nurse is receiving her training she is boarded free of
expense, and receives a stated salary per month during the time she is
in the school. The amount varies throughout the country. In New Haven it
is $170 for the term <span class="pagenum"><a id="page55"></a>[p.55]</span> of eighteen months. In Chicago, $8 a month
for the first year, $12 a month for the second year. In Boston, at two
of the schools it is $10 a month for the first year, and $14 a month for
the second year. At the third school it is $1 a week for the first six
months, $2 dollars a week for the second six months, and $3 a week for
the last four months. Brooklyn, $9 a month for the first year, $15 a
month for the second year. In New York, at the Charity Hospital on
Blackwell's Island, it is $10 a month for the first year, and $15 a
month for the second year; at Bellevue Hospital, $9 a month for the
first year, $15 a month for the second year; at the New York Hospital,
it is $10, $13, and $16 a month for the first, second, and third six
months, respectively. In Syracuse $10 a month. In Philadelphia, $5 a
month for the first six months, $10 a month for the second six months,
and $16 a month for the second year.</p>

<p>It will be seen at a glance that this is merely nominal pay, but it must
also be borne in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page56"></a>[p.56]</span> mind that the nurse is receiving instruction
in what is to be to her a profession. Then, again, she is under little
or no expense; she is boarded, lodged, has her washing done in the
institution, and the dress or uniform which she is obliged to wear costs
but a trifle, the material of which it is made being generally what is
called "seersucker."</p>

<p>After the nurse has received a certain amount of training, she is deemed
competent to go out to private service. She receives no extra pay for
this, her salary being paid into the institution, which, in that way, is
enabled partly to maintain itself.</p>

<p>When she goes to a private house, she carries with her a certificate of
recommendation signed by the lady superintendent of the school. When she
returns to the school, she brings with her a report of her conduct and
efficiency, either from one of the family or the medical attendant.
While engaged in this service, the people employing her must allow her
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page57"></a>[p.57]</span> reasonable time for rest in every twenty-four hours, and when
her services are needed for several consecutive nights, she is to have
at least six hours in the day out of the sick-room. Except in cases of
extreme illness, she is to be allowed opportunity to attend church once
every Sunday.</p>

<p>Appended to the rules of the Bellevue Hospital Training School, in
regard to this subject, are the following remarks:</p>

<p>"It is expected that nurses will bear in mind the importance of the
situation they have undertaken, and will evince, at all times, the
self-denial, forbearance, gentleness, and good temper so essential in
their attendance on the sick, and also to their character as Christian
nurses. They are to take the whole charge of the sick-room, doing
everything that is requisite in it, when called upon to do so. When
nursing in families where there are no servants, if their attention be
not of necessity wholly devoted to their patient, they are expected to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page58"></a>[p.58]</span> make themselves generally useful. They are to be careful not to
increase the expense of the family in any way. They are also most
earnestly charged to hold sacred the knowledge which, to a certain
extent, they must obtain of the private affairs of such households or
individuals as they may attend."</p>

<p>The field of employment which has just been described, offers great
opportunities for the proper kind of women to make an independent
livelihood. The work is hard and confining, but the pay, as women are
paid, is very good. A trained nurse never receives less than $20 a week,
her board being, of course, included, and more often she will get $25,
or even $30, a week; in fact, she can command her own price, and that
price will depend upon the wealth and liberality of her patrons, and the
ability which she brings to bear on the case in hand. Good nursing is
very often more important than good doctoring, and thousands of people
are willing to pay liberally for such exceptional help. The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page59"></a>[p.59]</span>
demand for trained nurses far exceeds the supply, and, provided a woman
has made herself fully competent in this peculiarly appropriate branch
of women's work, the extent of her employment will only be limited by
her physical strength to render the services required.</p>

<hr class="chap">
<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page60"></a>[p.60]</span> PROOF-READERS, COMPOSITORS, AND BOOKBINDERS.</h2>

<p>Men who employ women in trades and businesses where they have to work
for some length of time before they become skilled laborers have one
very strong objection against female help. "No sooner," they say, "do we
really begin to get some benefit from the woman's work, after having
borne long and patiently with her sins of omission and commission, than
along comes a good-looking young fellow and marries her."</p>

<p>For this reason women sometimes find it difficult to obtain entrance
into the most desirable establishments where trades can be learned. And
yet these same employers are not hostile to female labor; on the
contrary, they are <span class="pagenum"><a id="page61"></a>[p.61]</span> strongly in favor of it, but they say that
they are not willing to encourage it to the extent of sacrificing the
necessary time and trouble in making a woman perfect in a trade, and
then seeing her leave them to enter upon the presumably more congenial
duties of matrimony.</p>

<p>The woman, therefore, who desires to learn a trade may find this
difficulty meeting her at the threshold. All employers, however, are not
alike, and some establishment can generally be found where a woman can
learn the first principles of the occupation she wishes to follow; as
soon as she has attained a reasonable degree of proficiency in it, she
can get a position in a larger and better establishment, where the pay
will probably be higher and the surroundings more agreeable.</p>

<p>Of the three employments mentioned at the head of this chapter
proof-reading is probably the most pleasant. A woman to be properly
qualified must have a good education, and must have graduated from the
printer's case. A <span class="pagenum"><a id="page62"></a>[p.62]</span> great many young women who know nothing about
the compositor's trade think they can be good proof-readers, but they
may have a good collegiate education, and if they are not familiar with
the practical details of printing, as they can be learned in a printing
establishment, they will never amount to much as proof-readers. This is
the class of proof-readers who "get interested" in what they are
reading; they are on the look-out for bad sentences which, having found,
they promptly proceed to correct, a self-imposed duty for which they
receive no thanks from either their employer or the author whose
language or style they seek to improve. A good proof-reader reads
mechanically. The moment she takes a personal interest in what she is
reading, or becomes critical on the matter in hand, she is apt to
overlook typographical errors of the most common sort. Of course, she
must be a first-class speller and have a good knowledge of punctuation,
though how far she will have to apply the latter knowledge <span class="pagenum"><a id="page63"></a>[p.63]</span> will
depend very much on what kind of proof she is reading. If she is engaged
in an establishment where books are printed exclusively, she will find
that authors, as a rule, have their own systems of punctuation, with
which (supposing the authors to be men and women of ability) she will
not be expected to interfere. But if she is engaged on newspaper or
general work, she will have ample opportunity to display her knowledge
and exercise her judgment in the matter of punctuation. In all important
work female proof-readers seldom read the second or revised proof. That
is generally given to a male proof-reader of large experience, who gives
the matter a critical reading.</p>

<p>The pay of good women proof-readers is from $15 to $20 a week. Those who
receive the latter sum are capable of reading "revises." Now and then a
woman receives exceptionally good pay for this kind of service. A
prominent American historian paid a lady proof-reader $30 a week; but
she was unusually well educated, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page64"></a>[p.64]</span> and capable of often making
valuable suggestions to the author.</p>

<p>No encouragement can be given to the woman desirous of becoming a
proof-reader who will not learn the practical details of the calling in
a printing establishment.</p>

<p>In connection with proof-reading it may be mentioned that young girls or
young women find employment as "copy-holders." Their duty is to read
aloud to the proof-reader the copy of the author. If they can read
rapidly and correctly they can earn about $8 a week.</p>

<hr>

<p>Female compositors are now largely employed in job and newspaper
offices, but it is only fair to state the objections to their following
this trade. In some establishments they are obliged, like the men, to
stand at their work. Physicians state, and the experience of the women
themselves proves, that this is very detrimental to health. It has been
urged by women, also, that in printing-offices they are forced to hear
profane <span class="pagenum"><a id="page65"></a>[p.65]</span> and improper language from their male companions, who
sometimes, doubtless, in this way, harass the women, sometimes with the
purpose of expressing their dissatisfaction at the employment of female
labor. But too much weight should not be given to this complaint. In all
the large, well-regulated establishments such conduct would not be
tolerated, provided the men and women worked in the same room, which,
however, is rarely the case; as a rule, the female help are set off in
an apartment by themselves.</p>

<p>Employers who have employed female compositors say that they cause a
great deal of trouble. They have to have a separate room, and require to
be waited upon a great deal, especially if they are learning the trade,
while men readily get along by themselves. They are sure to lose more or
less time through sickness, and that, too, very often in the busiest
season, when there is great pressure of work, and their services are in
especial demand. Of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page66"></a>[p.66]</span> late, the female compositors in one of the
largest establishments in New York demanded to be paid the same rate as
the men. The demand was not acceded to, and the proprietors came very
near discharging all their female compositors, urging the objections
which have just been stated, together with the general objection to the
employment of female help stated in the beginning of this chapter.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all these objections, however, which a woman can weigh
and take for what they are worth, the trade of a compositor is a very
good one. Among men, a type-setter has always been considered the most
independent of mortals. If he is thorough master of his trade, he is
always sure of work, and with the great development of our country,
there is hardly a spot to which he may drift where he will not find a
printing-office and an opportunity to earn money. Numerous instances
might be related of printers who, being of a roving disposition, have
travelled all over <span class="pagenum"><a id="page67"></a>[p.67]</span> the United States, earning their living as
they went. The trade is just as good, or nearly as good, for a woman.
She is never paid, it is true, the same rate that the men receive, but
if she is a quick worker she can make much more money in a week, as a
compositor, than she could at many other occupations. She can never hope
to perform as much work as a first-class male compositor; that is a
physical impossibility.</p>

<p>Good compositors in the large New York establishments where books are
printed (and it is only in such places that women are employed in the
large cities), earn from $14 to $15 a week. The poor ones average $9 and
$10 a week. Sometimes good women make more than $15 a week, earning as
much as $18 or $20 a week. This kind of work, it must be understood, is
paid by the piece, so that how much a woman earns depends entirely on
her ability.</p>

<p>In many small cities and country towns, especially throughout New
England, young <span class="pagenum"><a id="page68"></a>[p.68]</span> women are employed as compositors in newspaper
offices. Their rate of pay is never as high as it is in the cities, but
their living expenses are proportionately less, so that really they are
just as well off. It would seem, indeed, that such situations were to be
preferred. There is less noise and hurry in such small establishments,
and, therefore, less wear and tear on the human system. The papers are
generally afternoon papers, and, therefore, the work is all done in the
daytime. The women are allowed to sit at their work. In such situations
they will be able to earn from $5 to $12 a week.</p>

<p>It is, at present, difficult for a woman entirely ignorant of the trade,
to get into any of the large establishments in New York, where such help
is engaged, for the purpose of learning to become a type-setter. If her
ambition lies in this direction, and she lives outside the large cities,
she could do no better than obtain an introductory knowledge of the art
in some <span class="pagenum"><a id="page69"></a>[p.69]</span> country newspaper office, or, failing in that, get the
necessary practical instruction in some job office, in either city or
country.</p>

<hr>

<p>Certain parts of the work of bookbinding are monopolized by young girls
and young women. They are employed in folding, collating, sewing,
pasting, binding, and gold-laying. There is probably no large
establishment in the country where men are employed to do this kind of
work. The industry seems to be peculiarly adapted to young women who are
quick with their hands.</p>

<p>Employés in this trade are paid by the piece, with the exception of the
collaters, who receive a stated salary of $8 a week. "Collating," it may
be mentioned for the benefit of those who are not familiar with the
term, means the gathering together of the various folded sheets or
sections of the book, and seeing that the pages run right, preparatory
to their being handed over to the sewers, who stitch them <span class="pagenum"><a id="page70"></a>[p.70]</span>
together. The pay of folders, binders, pasters, and sewers will average,
during the year, from $6 to $7 a week. Gold-layers are paid by the hour
and make a dollar or two more a week. This average, it must be
understood, is for the whole fifty-two weeks. Some weeks the girls make
$12 and $15, other weeks not one third as much. Girls as young as
fourteen years are employed, and women forty and fifty years of age may
be found working beside them. Nine hours and a half constitute a day's
work. Some girls will make more than the average named. Those are the
steady workers who, to use the expression of one employer, "work just
like a man and don't care to hurry home and crimp up to see company in
the evening." Such employés will, the year round, average each week two
or three dollars more than the ordinary run of help.</p>

<p>It is said that there is always work in this trade for competent women.
But it is a trade that no woman of ambition would want to enter,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page71"></a>[p.71]</span> unless she was unable to find any thing better to do. There is
no chance to rise in the business and get a better paying position, for
the rule is to employ male foremen. In only one large establishment in
New York is there a woman occupying such a position. It is proper to
state, however, that she gives perfect satisfaction, that her employer
would not replace her for a man, and that he believes other bookbinders
will eventually see the advisability of having a female instead of a
male overseer. A man, it is said, is apt, in giving out work, to favor
the pretty girls at the expense of the plain-looking damsels, thus
creating jealousy among the employés, while a woman is not influenced in
that way.</p>

<p>The proprietors of the large bookbinderies make every effort to secure a
respectable kind of help, but young women of loose principles, and
sometimes, it is to be feared, of actual immoral character, get
employment at the trade, and, when they do, their influence is any thing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page72"></a>[p.72]</span> but good on their companions. It must, however, be largely a
girl's own fault if she allows herself to associate with such company.
During working hours, of course, nothing but business is attended to.
Lunch is eaten in the establishment, and during the lunch hour the girls
gather together in little knots and talk about the last picnic or the
coming ball. But the place is so large, that a girl of reserved manners
can generally keep by herself, or select such companions as she prefers.</p>

<p>The trade is not difficult to learn, the work is neat and clean, the
rooms where the girls work&mdash;that is, in the large bookbinderies&mdash;are
commodious, well lighted, and airy. If a young woman, getting her board
free at home, wanted to make a little money by working only a few
months, or a year, she could probably accomplish this object by entering
a bookbindery.</p>

<hr class="chap">
<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page73"></a>[p.73]</span> THE DRAMA.&mdash;LECTURERS AND READERS.</h2>

<p>A woman need not have the genius of a Rachel, a Modjeska, or a Clara
Morris, to be able to make a good living in the theatrical profession.
Probably the great majority of young ladies who go upon the stage are
inflated with the notion that they are creatures of wonderful genius,
and for this reason they fail; they are so taken up with the good
opinion they have of themselves that they will not go through the
necessary amount of work, in the subordinate positions, to perfect
themselves for places up higher. They want to fly before they can walk.
It would seem as if common-sense deserted a woman the moment she felt a
desire to go upon the stage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page74"></a>[p.74]</span> An old theatrical agent whose views were sought on this subject
did not offer much encouragement to the aspirants for dramatic honors. I
will give a paraphrase of his views so that the gentle reader may have
the benefit of the pessimistic presentation of the question.</p>

<p>The great majority of young ladies, he observed, "who sought positions
had been members of some amateur dramatic company, which they had joined
from a love of recreation and amusement. The friends of a young woman
continually spoiled her by undeserved praise, and, finally, she believed
herself capable of taking the highest and most difficult parts, and
forthwith rushed to the nearest theatrical manager or dramatic agent and
sought a position. In the majority of instances such young ladies had
not the slightest amount of ability; besides, experience in an amateur
dramatic company was of no benefit. People might come to an agent with
the highest recommendations from stage instructors, or actors who had
taken upon <span class="pagenum"><a id="page75"></a>[p.75]</span> themselves the task of giving them instruction&mdash;who
had spoken of them as 'promising pupils'&mdash;and yet, when they came to go
upon the stage, they did not show the slightest degree of talent for the
profession. An amateur experience was no criterion to go by."</p>

<p>"When," said the dramatic agent, "I managed the tour of Mr.
&mdash;&mdash; (mentioning the name of one of our leading tragedians), I had to
select the company which was to support him. Yielding to the
solicitations of an old friend I engaged a young lady who had been
studying with Miss &mdash;&mdash;, one of the brightest stars on the American
stage. Miss &mdash;&mdash; told me that she considered her a most promising young
woman, and had it not been that her manager had already selected her
company, she would have been glad to have had her in her own company.
She felt sure if I took her I would be pleased. I engaged her, and was
never more mistaken in my ideas in all my life. She thought she could
act, but she did not know the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page76"></a>[p.76]</span> first principles of acting.
Offended at my plain criticisms on her efforts she went to Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, the
star, and complained that she thought I was prejudiced against her, and
had been unjust and unkind. But Mr. &mdash;&mdash; repeated, kindly but plainly,
the substance of what I had said. She had left a good paying position to
seek dramatic fame only to find dramatic failure. At the end of the
season she became convinced of the truth of our criticisms, and quit the
stage forever."</p>

<p>It must be stated here that the stage is largely run on what is called
the "combination" plan, and a very poor plan it is. In the old times the
theatres had what were called "stock" companies; that is, the company
was made up of a certain number of members, each member having a
particular line of "business," and keeping to that line year after year,
in the same company, which remained in the same theatre. At the present
time there are only two "stock" companies in the United States. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page77"></a>[p.77]</span>
The great majority of theatrical enterprises are called "combinations."
In old times the actor had to suit himself to the play; nowadays the
play is written to suit the actor. A comedian can sing and dance, or
"make up" good as a Jew, a Negro, or an eccentric German, and forthwith
he gets some author to write a play for him in which his "strong" points
will be made to plainly appear. Then he selects his company, picking out
men and women that he may deem suitable for the characters they are to
assume. Then the company is christened "The Great Jones Combination," or
"The Great Scott Combination," as the case may be, and off it starts for
a more or less successful tour throughout the country.</p>

<p>Sterling, old-time actors like John Gilbert, William Warren, Joseph
Jefferson, and men of that school, lament the decadence of the "stock"
company system. But, in the dramatic as in the real world, we must take
things as we find them, and the fact is that there is very <span class="pagenum"><a id="page78"></a>[p.78]</span>
little chance for a young lady who would be an actress to get a thorough
knowledge of her art&mdash;that is, thorough as it is understood by those in
the front rank of the profession, who have reached their position by
following the old methods.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the stage never offered so many opportunities for
bright young women with dramatic talent to make a living as it does at
the present time. Every city, both large and small, can boast of its
theatre or opera-house, and in many of the large towns throughout the
country there are town-halls arranged with a view to accommodate some of
the minor theatrical combinations.</p>

<p>The young lady who would succeed in making a fair living on the stage
must, first of all, be attractive. The stage appeals as much to the eye
as it does to the ear, and there is scarcely an instance of an ugly
actress being successful, or, indeed, even having the opportunity of
exhibiting herself on the stage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page79"></a>[p.79]</span> It seems to be the general opinion among actors and theatrical
managers that the instruction received from professors of elocution is
of little or no account. As to the experience gained from performing in
amateur companies, there is a difference of opinion. The dramatic agent
whose views have just been given speaks, it will be seen, very strongly
against the amateur actor. Others, however, whose opinions are entitled
to great weight, say that experience gained in amateur organizations is
always valuable. The manager of one of the principal theatres in New
York&mdash;a theatre, too, that has had an unusually large number of
travelling companies on the road&mdash;told the writer that he had employed a
large number of amateur actors, and that some of the greatest pecuniary
successes had been made by actors and actresses who had come to him from
some amateur theatrical company. Of course, the new-comers were not
successful at first. They had to serve an apprenticeship on the regular
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page80"></a>[p.80]</span> stage; but he meant to say that their previous experience,
amateur though it was, had been a benefit to them, and that they had got
along quicker than they would if they had been without it.</p>

<p>"Utility business" is the kind of work a young woman going upon the
stage must first expect to do; or, to speak more accurately, according
to the technique of the profession, she will first be allowed to make an
"announcement." She will come on the stage and say, "My lady, a letter,"
or make some other simple speech to the extent of one or two lines. If
she does this well, she will be given parts where there is more to say,
until, finally, she has reached thirty lines, at which point she is
capable of being entrusted with a "responsible" part. The salary of this
class of actresses ranges from $15 to $30 per week.</p>

<p>If she does not start in this line of business, she may be a "ballet
lady,"&mdash;not a dancer, but one of the group of ladies that make up the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page81"></a>[p.81]</span> ballroom or party scenes. In this case, she will start on a
salary of from $5 to $7 per week. If she is very pretty, she will get
$7; if she is an "ancient,"&mdash;that is, rather old and decidedly
plain,&mdash;she will get only $5. The ability to sing commands an extra
dollar per week. The manager of the theatre alluded to above said, that
in one of their companies they employed a young lady without previous
theatrical experience. She was, however, very quick to learn, and
commencing on a salary of $20 a week, she quickly made herself valuable.
After a while a part was given her in which she made "a hit," and her
salary has been increased until now it is $70 a week when she is
travelling, and $55 a week when she plays in New York City, the extra
$15 given to her when she is away being for hotel expenses.</p>

<p>There has been so much said and written on the morals of the stage that
it will not be necessary here to warn the young dramatic aspirant that
this is a branch of the subject which she <span class="pagenum"><a id="page82"></a>[p.82]</span> should well consider.
That there are actresses who are good women, fulfilling nobly all the
duties of wives, mothers, and sisters, nobody pretends to deny. But that
the stage offers very strong and dangerous temptations to young and
pretty women is a fact which every one who knows any thing about the
subject will admit. These temptations are not in the theatre itself. The
profession of acting is conducted on purely business principles. Life
behind the scenes is dull, uninteresting, matter-of-fact. The actors and
the actresses are full of their work, and the whole place is decidedly
unromantic. But there are great temptations from without the theatre,
into the details of which it is not necessary to enter. It is not
necessary that she should yield to these temptations, nor are they,
probably, all things considered, any greater or stronger than the pretty
shop-girl has to meet. But if she values her character she will, when
she enters this profession, make up her mind to devote herself
thoroughly to work, and she will <span class="pagenum"><a id="page83"></a>[p.83]</span> be particularly careful about
the acquaintances she forms with the opposite sex, and above all avoid
that large and growing class of silly men, both young and old, who love
to boast that they number an "actress" among their female acquaintances.</p>

<p>In the <i>North American Review</i> for December, 1882, there was published a
symposium on the subject of success on the stage. There are so many
young ladies whose ambition lies in the direction of the drama, and the
contribution referred to contained such wholesome advice, that I am
tempted to quote from it at considerable length. There were six
contributors: John McCullough, Joseph Jefferson, Lawrence Barrett,
William Warren, Miss Maggie Mitchell, and Madame Helena Modjeska. The
views of the lady contributors will be found of especial interest to the
readers of this book.</p>

<p>The article was addressed more particularly to those whose ambition it
is to reach the highest rank in the profession, but the extracts
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page84"></a>[p.84]</span> contain many useful hints for those who are simply looking
forward to a respectable, well-paying "utility" position on the stage.</p>

<p>Miss Mitchell says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To succeed on the stage, the candidate must have a fairly prepossessing
appearance, a mind capable of receiving picturesque impressions easily
and deeply, a strong, artistic sense of form and color, the faculty of
divesting herself of her own mental as well as physical identity, a
profound sympathy with her art, utter sincerity in assuming a character,
power enough over herself to refrain from analyzing or dissecting her
part, a habit of generalization, and at the same time a quick eye and
ready invention for detail, a resonant voice, a distinct articulation,
natural grace, presence of mind, a sense of humor so well under control
that it will never run riot; the gift of being able to transform
herself, at will, into any type of character; pride, even conceit, in
her work; patience, tenacity of purpose, industry, good-humor, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page85"></a>[p.85]</span>
and docility. She must behave, in her earlier years, very much as if she
were a careful, self-respecting scholar, taking lessons of people better
informed than herself, with her eyes and ears constantly open and ready
to receive impressions.</p>

<p>"She should begin by getting, if possible, into a stock company, even in
the most inferior capacity, keeping within reach of the influence of her
home,&mdash;or by joining a reputable combination on the road. Managers, no
matter what may be said to the contrary, are always eagerly looking for
talent in the bud, and if a young girl, with reasonable pretensions to
good looks, who is modest and well-behaved, and shows the slightest
ability with a common-sense readiness to begin at the bottom of the
ladder, should offer herself for an engagement, the chances are that she
would get it with much less difficulty than she imagined. There are, no
doubt, numerous candidates, even for the smallest positions on the
stage, but those <span class="pagenum"><a id="page86"></a>[p.86]</span> who possess even moderate qualifications are
extremely rare. Managers have, at present, to take the best they can
pick from a host of worse than interlopers.</p>

<p>"I do not think that novices reap any practical benefit from private
lessons. The neophyte learns not merely of her professional teacher, but
of her audience; and to be informed by the one without being influenced
by the other is to have very lopsided instruction. The stage itself is
the best, in fact, the only school for actresses. It is a profession
made up of traditions and precedents and technicalities. Mere oral
advice, or training in elocution or gesture, counts for very little.
They are, in fact, too often obstacles which have to be eventually and
with difficulty surmounted. In some instances I have known
'instruction'&mdash;of this sort&mdash;to bring about as prejudicial effects as if
the victim had tried to learn the art of swimming at a dancing academy,
and then put the knowledge thus gained into practice. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page87"></a>[p.87]</span> The
modulations of the voice and the language of illustrative gesture ought
to be either taught by example or insensibly acquired by experience. To
learn them by precept and rule has for a result, usually, that
woodenness and jerkiness which one cannot help noticing in the 'youthful
prodigies' of the stage. To be an actress one has to learn other things
than merely how to act, and that is why nobody ever succeeded in the
profession who tried to enter it at the top. <span class="spaced1">* * *</span></p>

<p>"The early bent of her studies and reading should be precisely the same
as that of any other woman aspiring to be liberally educated. She
should, if possible, speak French, at all events read it. She should be
familiar with English literature. She should cultivate an acquaintance,
through books and otherwise, with the highest as well as the lowest
forms of human society. Refinement and general information ought to be
the characteristics of every actress. <span class="spaced1">* * *</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page88"></a>[p.88]</span> "It would be bold for me to pretend to descry the chances of
success for the actress of the future. It is a lottery, this profession
of ours, in which even the prizes are, after all, not very considerable.
My own days, spent most of them far from my children and the comforts
and delights of my home, are full of exhausting labor. Rehearsals and
other business occupy me from early morning to the hour of performance,
with brief intervals for rest and food and a little sleep. In the best
hotels my time is so invaded that I can scarcely live comfortably, much
less luxuriously. At the worst, existence becomes a torment and a
burden. I am the eager, yet weary, slave of my profession, and the best
it can do for me&mdash;who am fortunate enough to be included among its
successful members&mdash;is to barely palliate the suffering of a
forty-weeks' exile from my own house and my family.</p>

<p>"For those of our calling who have to make this weary round, year after
year, with disappointed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page89"></a>[p.89]</span> ambitions and defeated hopes as their
inseparable company, I can feel from the bottom of my heart. Each season
makes the life harder and drearier; each year robs it of one more
prospect, one more chance, one more opportunity to try and catch the
fleeting bubble in another field."</p>

<p>Madame Modjeska writes:</p>

<p>"<span class="spaced1">* * *</span> It would be a great mistake to choose the profession with the
idea that money comes easier and work is less hard in this than in any
other. There is little hope for the advancement of such aspirants.</p>

<p>"There is no greater mistake than to suppose that mere professional
training is the only necessary education. The general cultivation of the
mind, the development of all the intellectual faculties, the knowledge
how to think, are more essential to the actor than mere professional
instruction. In no case should he neglect the other branches of art; all
of them being so nearly akin, he cannot attain to a fine artistic
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page90"></a>[p.90]</span> taste if he is entirely unacquainted with music, the plastic
arts, and poetry.</p>

<p>"The best school of acting seems to me to be the stage itself&mdash;when one
begins by playing small parts, and slowly, step by step, reaches the
more important ones. There is a probability that if you play well a
minor character, you will play greater ones well by and by; while if you
begin with the latter, you may prove deficient in them, and afterward be
both unwilling and unable to play small parts. It was my ill-fortune to
be put, soon after my entrance on the stage, in the position of a star
in a travelling company. I think it was the greatest danger I
encountered in my career, and the consequence was that when I afterward
entered a regular stock company, I had not only a great deal to learn,
but much more to unlearn.</p>

<p>"The training by acting, in order to be useful, requires a certain
combination of circumstances. It is good in the stock companies of
Europe, because with them the play-bill is constantly <span class="pagenum"><a id="page91"></a>[p.91]</span> changed,
and the young actor is required to appear in a great variety of
characters during a short period. But it may prove the reverse of good
in a theatre where the beginner may be compelled for a year or so to
play one insignificant part. Such a course would be likely to kill in
him all the love of his art, render him a mechanical automaton, and
teach him but very little.</p>

<p>"Private instruction can be given either by professors of elocution or
by experienced actors. I know nothing of the first, as there are no
professors of elocution, to my knowledge, outside of America and of
England, and I never knew one personally. But speaking of private
lessons given by experienced actors, there are certainly a great many
arguments and instances in favor of that mode of instruction. Of course,
a great deal depends upon the choice of the teacher. But, supposing he
is capable, he can devote more time to a private pupil than he can to
one in a public school. Some of the greatest <span class="pagenum"><a id="page92"></a>[p.92]</span> actresses that
ever lived owed, in great part, their success to the instructions of an
experienced actor, of less genius than themselves. Take, for instance,
Rachel and Samson. Strange to say, it happens often that very good
actors make but poor professors, while the best private teacher I ever
met was, like Michonnet, but an indifferent actor himself. The danger is
that the pupil in this kind of instruction may become a mere imitator of
his model. Imitation is the worst mode of learning, and the worst method
in art, as it kills the individual creative power, and in most cases,
the imitators only follow the peculiar failings of their model.</p>

<p>"There are many objections to dramatic schools, some of which are very
forcible. There is in them, as in private teaching, the danger of
imitation, and of getting into a purely mechanical habit, which produces
conventional, artificial acting. Yet it is not to be denied that a great
number of the best French and German actresses and actors have been
pupils of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page93"></a>[p.93]</span> dramatic schools, and that two of the schools&mdash;those
of Paris and Vienna&mdash;have justly enjoyed a great celebrity. Of the
schools I have known personally I cannot speak very favorably. One point
must be borne in mind; a dramatic school ought to have an independent
financial basis, and not rely for its support on the number of its
pupils, because in such a case the managers might be induced to receive
candidates not in the least qualified for the dramatic profession.</p>

<p>"Of the three elements that, in my opinion, go to make up a good
dramatic artist, the first one, technique, must be acquired by
professional training; the second and higher one, which is art itself,
originates in a natural genius, but can and ought to be improved by the
general cultivation of the mind. But there is yet something beyond these
two: it is inspiration. This cannot be acquired or improved, but it can
be lost by neglect. Inspiration, which Jefferson calls his demon, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page94"></a>[p.94]</span> which I would call my angel, does not depend upon us. Happy the
moments when it responds to our appeal. It is only at such moments that
an artist can feel satisfaction in his work&mdash;pride in his creation; and
this feeling is the only real and true success which ought to be the
object of his ambition."</p>

<hr>

<p>There is but very little chance for women to succeed as lecturers at the
present time. Some few years ago the country seemed to be overrun with
orators, both male and female. Probably the woman-suffrage excitement
had a great deal to do with this; at all events, there is not much
demand now for female eloquence. Twelve years ago a number of
distinguished women were before the public. Anna Dickinson spoke on
politics; since then she entered the dramatic profession. Susan B.
Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, spoke about woman-suffrage, a subject
which seems for the time to have died out. Olive Logan talked on social
topics; now she is in Europe. Mrs. Livermore is the only female <span class="pagenum"><a id="page95"></a>[p.95]</span>
orator of that time who is now before the public, and she is as
successful now as she was then.</p>

<hr>

<p>As public readers, women who have a talent in that direction have an
excellent chance at the present time. "Readings" are getting to be a
very popular form of entertainment. The theatres are offering such poor
and trashy attractions that many educated people who want to be amused,
are forced to seek diversion in this way. The general spread of culture
is also, probably, creating a taste in this direction.</p>

<p>The lady who would succeed as a public reader must, like the actress, be
good-looking. The most successful lady readers now before the public are
physically attractive. Some of them are large, fine-looking women, while
others are petite; but no matter what the particular style of beauty may
be, they are all pleasing in their personal appearance.</p>

<p>The woman who wants to make public reading a profession will do all she
can to get her name and profession before the public. At first <span class="pagenum"><a id="page96"></a>[p.96]</span>
she will give free readings before church societies. In this way she
will gradually become known, and, after a while, she will be able to
appear before some lyceum in the small outlying towns. If she is
favorably received she will be invited to come again, and so, gradually,
her name and fame will become known, and if she has the necessary talent
she will eventually command very good pay.</p>

<p>At first she will give free readings. Her readings for pay will, in the
beginning, bring her from $10 to $25 a reading. After that the
compensation will increase, according to her reputation as a reader. The
very best female readers, or "elocutionists," as they prefer to term
themselves, receive as much as $500 for one entertainment.</p>

<p>The social position which a lady occupies will have much to do with her
success. If she has a large circle of influential friends in good social
standing, provided, of course, she is talented, she will find the road
to success much easier than it otherwise would be.</p>

<hr class="chap">
<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page97"></a>[p.97]</span> BOOK-AGENTS.</h2>

<p>Canvassing for books is a business in which some men have been known to
make $10,000 a year, and a large number of other men have earned $2,000
and $3,000 in the same length of time. This is an occupation which,
under certain conditions, is admitted to be just as suitable for a woman
as a man.</p>

<p>The newspapers have poked a great deal of fun at book-agents, and their
ridicule has, doubtless, deterred many a person from following the
occupation. A young man, a book-agent, once wrote for advice to the
editor of a New York paper. He said that he had followed the calling for
some time, and that he made, the year round, from $50 to $60 a week. He
liked the work of travelling from place to place, but he had doubts
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page98"></a>[p.98]</span> as to whether his calling was a respectable one. Would it not
be better for him to get some other employment? The editor promptly
informed him that the work he was doing was not only respectable but
exceedingly useful; that many persons were glad to see him present to
their notice the new and useful books he was endeavoring to sell; that
his earnings were exceptionally large, and that it would be a long time
before he could hope to earn as much in any other business. By all means
he should remain a book-agent.</p>

<p>It is said by the publishers of books that women make excellent
book-agents; they cannot hope to make as much money as the very best
male agents, but if they have the necessary qualifications they can do
very well. The prerequisites required can be summed up under four heads:</p>

<p>First of all, a woman must have pretty good health; if she has not, she
will not be able to go through the necessary amount of physical <span class="pagenum"><a id="page99"></a>[p.99]</span>
exercise involved in the work. But it is not necessary that she shall be
perfectly sound in body. Many a woman enters the business because she
has a delicate constitution, and because she believes that the exercise
she will be obliged to take will do her good. And if her ailments are
not too serious, she is seldom disappointed in this respect.</p>

<p>Second, she must have a great deal of what business men call "push," and
what some people might term impudence. She cannot afford to be nervous
about going into stores, offices, and houses, and offering what she has
for sale. Nor will it go well with her if she is bad-natured, and shows
temper when she is not greeted cordially by the master or mistress of
the house. She must have smiles and pleasant words for those who do not
buy as well as for those who do.</p>

<p>Third, she must be a good judge of human nature, and on this one
commandment, probably, hangs all the law and the prophets of
book-canvassing. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page100"></a>[p.100]</span> For, if she has been a student of mankind she
will use great judgment in her vocation. She will call at the proper
time, at the proper place, upon the kind of people who will most likely
want to see her, or rather the book she has to offer. She will, by her
demeanor, win the respect of the men, the admiration of the women, and
the love of the children. It seems like saying a great deal too much,
but it is a fact, that there are some lady book-agents whose calls are
remembered as angels' visits, so agreeable were they in their manners,
so charming in conversation. It must be admitted, however, that there
are not many such women roaming up and down through the country.</p>

<p>Last of all, she must have great perseverance, and work continuously.
Women get very easily discouraged, no matter what occupation they
pursue, if they do not very quickly see some substantial return for
their work. The idea that "hope springs eternal in the human breast,"
was certainly never meant to apply to women; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page101"></a>[p.101]</span> nor, maybe, was
it meant to, seeing that it occurs in the "Essay on Man." The female
book-agent is very much depressed if she does not make good earnings at
the start. Her depression so affects her spirits that she cannot be as
industrious as she otherwise would, and so she does more and more poorly
until, finally, she gives up the business. Men agents do not, as a rule,
become discouraged so easy. They know that provided they have got a good
book, published by a good house, it is only a question of time when they
will be making good earnings. Women should go to work in the same
spirit.</p>

<p>If poor success is apt to discourage a woman (and, in what I say now I
am only the mouthpiece of several publishers I have seen), a run of very
good luck is liable to demoralize her. It is said that some lady agents,
after making a considerable sum of money in a short space of time, will
at once stop work, and, retiring to their homes, will not think of
following the employment <span class="pagenum"><a id="page102"></a>[p.102]</span> until their means are exhausted. Of
course that is foolish. While they are spending their time in idleness
some new-comer has been assigned to the field they found so profitable.
When they return to work it is with a listless spirit, and it will be
quite a while before they can summon up that old-time energy, which
comes, in any vocation, from long and continuous performance.</p>

<p>Women book-agents&mdash;and, in defence of this ungallant remark, I must
state again that "I say the tale as 'twas said to me"&mdash;women
book-agents are apt to waste a great deal of time in the spring and fall
in getting their wardrobes ready for the coming season. "Who ever knew
of a man," remarked a cynical publisher, "stopping work for two or three
weeks because he was going to have a suit of clothes made? No one. And
yet you will find a female book-agent stop canvassing in the busiest
season in order to superintend the making of her dresses." Of course,
all lady book-agents do <span class="pagenum"><a id="page103"></a>[p.103]</span> not adopt this practice, but it is
well to allude to the custom, because it is very unbusiness-like, and
furnishes a hint in the direction of how not to succeed.</p>

<p>Two classes of women, publishers find, seek the employment of
book-canvassing. A great many young ladies enter the business&mdash;it might
be said skip into it&mdash;with all the gayety and with all the inexperience
of youth. These young persons are about eighteen or nineteen years of
age; they are buoyant of nature, full of hope, bursting with
self-confidence. They work a few days or weeks, then abandon the
business, tearfully proclaiming that it wasn't any thing like what they
thought it would be.</p>

<p>The really successful female book-agent belongs to the second class. She
is of middle age, sometimes single, sometimes a widow, or, it may be,
she is married, and is bravely assisting a sick or unfortunate husband
in the support of the family. Such a woman enters the business with the
idea of making it her vocation. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page104"></a>[p.104]</span> If she is a single lady or a
widow, she is not on the look-out for a husband, when she should be
carefully watching for customers. Having passed the youthful stage of
life, she is apt to be a pretty good judge of human nature, and, at all
events, she will be quick to learn the ways and weaknesses of men when
she is thus forced to daily come in contact with them.</p>

<p>The earnings of this latter class of women are sometimes very large. Of
course, the reader understands that book-agents almost invariably work
upon a commission.</p>

<p>That commission varies. On some books it is only ten per cent.; on
others it is sixty per cent. The better the book the less the per centage
of profit; but, let it be remembered also, the better the book, the more
ease in obtaining subscribers. Some women make $50 a week for many weeks
running; some earn $30 a week the year round. One lady made enough money
in two years' canvassing to send her boy to college, and to purchase a
home. In fact, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page105"></a>[p.105]</span> the earnings of book-agents, even the best of
them, cannot even be approximately stated. It is sufficient to say that
a woman with the proper qualifications, who strictly attends to her
business, who is persevering, full of courage, and who works diligently,
is sure to succeed. No, there is one thing more needed&mdash;a good book.</p>

<p>There are a great number of subscription books offered to agents every
year, but out of the whole lot very few of them are of real value. And
yet, it is not necessary that a book should be, intellectually speaking,
first-class, in order to meet with a sale. Some books issued by
subscription at the present time cost $20 and $30 apiece. There is a
cyclopedia for which the price is over $100. Such books as these, it has
been found, must be sold by male agents only. It has also been
discovered that women are most successful in the sale of books of a
religious or semi-religious character, issued at a reasonable price. The
reason <span class="pagenum"><a id="page106"></a>[p.106]</span> for this is apparent. They are brought in contact with
the female members of families, and in thus meeting members of their own
sex they are at no loss for interesting topics of conversation. For the
successful book-agent, it is needless to say, does not, the moment she
enters a house, present her wares and cry boldly "Buy"; she "leads up"
to the business in hand.</p>

<p>In selecting a book a woman should go to a first-class publisher and
pick out a work which, according to her judgment (and without much
regard to what he may say, because he may very often be wrong), will
meet a popular household demand. Let her beware of all the small
catch-penny kind of publications; reproductions, from old and worn-out
stereotype plates, of books that no one, who really cares for books,
will be likely to buy. There are so many good subscription books coming
from the press in the present day that there is hardly any excuse for a
woman who will waste her <span class="pagenum"><a id="page107"></a>[p.107]</span> time in canvassing for poor ones. Of
course, the hasty books outnumber the books of real merit, but there are
enough of the latter to furnish employment to all the women who will be
likely to engage in this occupation.</p>

<p>To give an example of the kind of publisher to be avoided, I may state
that in a large Eastern city there is a man who makes it his business,
at certain seasons of the year, to advertise for young lady agents. He
always wants "<i>young</i> ladies," and he always wants them to be without
experience. He publishes but one book, of which he is the putative
author. The young ladies receive their board and a trifle for spending
money at the end of every week, all living under one roof. Accounts are
settled only semi-annually. At the end of the first six months it is
very generally found that the young lady agent is in debt to her
publisher for board, and, at all events, whatever the statement of
affairs may reveal, she is told that her services are no longer
required, and a fresh and inexperienced <span class="pagenum"><a id="page108"></a>[p.108]</span> damsel is at once
secured to take her place.</p>

<hr>

<p>While writing on the subject of agents, it may be well to put down a
suggestion made to the author of this little book by a prominent
florist. He said that it was surprising to him that ladies were not
employed to solicit orders for trees, flowers, and seeds, etc. To his
knowledge, no women were engaged in this occupation, and yet it seemed
to be one for which they were especially fitted. Agents of this
character, it appears, carry with them large books containing highly
illuminated drawings of the trees or plants they are endeavoring to
sell. A lady could appeal with particular propriety to females who would
be likely to be purchasers. The competition in the nursery business has
been very great during the past few years, but the profits of agents are
said to be good. As this is a new field of female labor, it might be
worth while for a woman who has a fancy for such work to endeavor to
secure an agency.</p>

<hr class="chap">
<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page109"></a>[p.109]</span> DRESS-MAKING&mdash;MILLINERY.</h2>

<p>From the modest appearance of the thousands of dwellings throughout the
country that bear the legend: "Fashionable Dress- and Cloak-making," no
one would suppose it was a very lucrative employment. Indeed, from the
dingy and broken-down aspect of some of the establishments referred to,
grave doubts might be entertained as to whether the inmates were able to
earn the most modest kind of a living. The fact is that the great
majority of dress-makers who set up in business for themselves are not
very successful, for the reason that, in most cases, they have a very
superficial knowledge of the trade, and cannot meet the demand for good
work.</p>

<p>A really first-class dress-maker is always sure <span class="pagenum"><a id="page110"></a>[p.110]</span> of work, in
either city or country. In order to be first-class she must have served
an apprenticeship with, or learned the trade of, a woman who is actively
engaged in the business. A great many women think they can get a good
knowledge of dress-making by the use of charts and patterns. This is not
the fact. Undoubtedly charts and patterns are very useful for women who
cut and make their own dresses, and they are aids in cutting and fitting
generally; but so many changes have to be made, depending on the size
and style of the woman to be fitted, and so much judgment is required to
be used, that competent critics say that they are of no value to the
professional dress-maker. One lady remarked that if all women were
perfectly formed, charts and patterns would be a great help; but as the
modern Eves come very far short of physical perfection, not much help
could be got from them.</p>

<p>Some authorities say that dress-making as a trade is not so good a
business in New York <span class="pagenum"><a id="page111"></a>[p.111]</span> as it was some ten years ago. The large
dress-makers who employ considerable help are obliged to select the best
locations in the city for their establishments, where the rent is very
high, and to furnish their places in a style very much more expensive
than in former years. As a consequence they do not pay as good wages as
they once did, on account of having to lay out money in these ways.</p>

<p>Another change from the old methods is that the work of dress-making is,
at the present time, divided into various departments. One woman will
make the skirt, another will finish it, another will work on the
sleeves, another will work the button-holes, and the fitting and draping
are branches by themselves. The woman who would receive the highest
wages to be obtained in this industry should master the whole business,
and make herself competent to do all, or nearly all, the kinds of work
which have just been mentioned. If she does do that, she need have no
fear about obtaining employment. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page112"></a>[p.112]</span> There are thousands of
dress-makers in the country, but very few good ones. It is a trade of
which it may be emphatically said that there is "room at the top."</p>

<p>The dress-making season lasts from October 1st to February 1st; then
there is very little to do until March 10th, when business becomes brisk
and remains so until about the 1st of August. The hours of work are from
8 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> until 6 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> In the busy season it is often necessary to work in
the evening. The pay ranges from $6 to $8 per week for ordinary hands,
while competent women receive $10, $12, and $14 a week. The forelady in
a dress-making establishment will receive $15 or $20 a week. It is her
duty to superintend the girls, to see that they arrive on time, to give
out the work, and to see that it is done promptly and properly.</p>

<p>Some women who follow this calling prefer to go out to private families
and work by the day. For such service they receive $3 or $3.50 <span class="pagenum"><a id="page113"></a>[p.113]</span>
a day. In many respects this is a pleasant method, but it has its
disadvantages. A woman is not always sure of how much she will earn
unless, after years of work, she has secured the custom of a certain
number of families, on whose patronage she can depend. There is so much
responsibility and worriment attached to this way of working at the
trade that the majority of dress-makers prefer to hire themselves out by
the week, and feel sure of receiving each Saturday night a stated amount
for their services.</p>

<p>The objection that applies to going out to private service is urged
against a woman going into the business on her own account. Besides, in
large cities it would require considerable capital to pursue such a
course. A dingy, insignificant little place could not hope to get much
custom, and to compete with the large establishments a woman would have
to be prepared to pay a high rent, lay out a large amount in furniture,
and then, probably, have to wait a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page114"></a>[p.114]</span> long time before she could
be the owner of a good paying business. Still, if she has plenty of
capital, thoroughly understands the trade, and is enterprising in her
methods of securing business, there is no reason why she should not
succeed, provided she has a good location.</p>

<hr>

<p>Only the rich and the utterly incompetent patronize the milliner
nowadays. It seems that women are very prompt to attend the "openings"
in the spring and fall seasons, but the great majority of them do so
only to see the styles. They go home and, unless they are very poor
hands with the needle, make their bonnets themselves. A hat that would
cost $5 in the store, a woman of taste could make for $1.50; and one
that would cost $15 she could duplicate for a five-dollar bill.</p>

<p>An idea can thus be formed of the profits of the business, and the
suggestion will probably occur to the reader that it is a good business
to follow. If a woman could secure a good store, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page115"></a>[p.115]</span> at a
reasonable rent, in a nice neighborhood, she would have a fair chance of
doing well. Of course it is to be supposed that she understands the
milliner's trade, and that she has gained her knowledge in a practical
way. It is seldom, however, that women are successful as proprietors of
such stores. Either they have made a mistake in selecting a location, or
their means become exhausted while waiting for custom during the early
dull days of their venture. It would take at least $2,000 or $3,000 to
start a millinery store. A woman of unusually good taste and sound
business judgment might get along with $1,000. The best location in New
York City would be between Fourteenth and Thirty-third streets, and
Broadway and Sixth Avenue; or on Broadway or Sixth Avenue.</p>

<hr class="chap">
<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page116"></a>[p.116]</span> TEACHING.</h2>

<p>The profession of teaching would seem, at a first glance, to be
overcrowded. School committees who are charged with the duty of
selecting tutors are, it is said, overwhelmed with applicants for the
positions that are to be filled. Young women are constantly striving to
get places in academies, and the host of females who are seeking
situations in the public schools of New York is, indeed, mighty.
Notwithstanding this discouraging view, a thoroughly qualified teacher
need seldom be without employment. The women who have had a solid
systematic training in the English branches, and who, in addition to
mere mental qualifications, have the knack, or genius, it might be
called, of reaching the minds of the young, are very few. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page117"></a>[p.117]</span>
There are plenty of superficially educated young women who "take up"
teaching as their profession. They are not thoroughly grounded in the
very rudiments of knowledge; they have no knowledge of, or sympathy
with, children; they go through their work in a purely mechanical
spirit; and they are utterly unfitted, in every way, for the profession
they have selected for themselves. The woman who makes teaching her
profession must have real ability, and feel herself thoroughly <i>adapted</i>
for the calling.</p>

<p>No woman, unless she has great "influence," can hope to obtain a
position in the public schools of New York. The western part of our
country seems to be a good field for well-qualified teachers, who must,
however, be endowed with some courage.</p>

<p>The country is a good place for a young lady to begin work. Positions
are more easily secured, and the qualifications required are not so
great as in the city.</p>

<p>In the schools throughout the country the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page118"></a>[p.118]</span> salaries of female
teachers range from $300 to $1,200 a year. The smaller salary would be
given in a country school; the higher salaries would be paid in the
academies in the large towns, and in cities.</p>

<hr>

<p>Teaching young children by the Kindergarten method has become very
popular within the past few years, and there is quite a demand for the
establishment of Kindergarten schools. In New York young ladies can
learn this method of teaching in two schools; one a free school
connected with a society devoted to "ethical culture," and a private
school. The instruction given in the former is free, but the young women
are expected to devote part of the day to the free scholars. This is an
advantage, for it gives them a practical knowledge of the method. During
the week there are three theoretical lessons, each lasting about two
hours. So many are desirous of entering this institution, that it has
been found necessary to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page119"></a>[p.119]</span> have a competitive examination for the
admission of candidates. In the private school the price of tuition is
$200. In Boston there are twenty kindergartens, all carried on by a
lady. The salary of the teachers there is $600. In private families
teachers are paid from $400 to $600; there is a good demand for
instructors in that quarter. The price obtained from scholars taught in
a kindergarten school depends solely on how much they can afford to pay;
probably $50 for the school year of nine months would be the average
price.</p>

<hr>

<p>The educational market is overstocked with teachers of languages. There
are so many poor, broken-down foreigners in America who are perfectly
competent to teach their respective languages, that there is a very
small chance for home talent. A good teacher, in the city of New York,
will receive $1 an hour; but there are some who will teach as low as 25
cents an hour, and there are others who, through their <span class="pagenum"><a id="page120"></a>[p.120]</span> good
address and social qualifications, will secure an entrance into
fashionable society, and receive as high as $5 an hour for doing no
better service than their poorer-paid sisters. In academies and schools
a lady teaching French and German will receive her board and from $300
to $800 a year. She must have learned these languages abroad, and have
the real foreign accent, or she cannot obtain employment at these rates.
If she has obtained her knowledge in this country, the salary will be
from $300 to $500.</p>

<hr>

<p>Music is now so generally taught to children, that there is a good
chance for competent female teachers of the art to obtain scholars.
There is a wide range in the prices paid for tuition; some teachers
receive only 50 cents a lesson, and some as high as $8. Those who
receive the latter sum are women of very great ability, who train young
ladies to become public performers. The terms depend almost altogether
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page121"></a>[p.121]</span> on the wealth of the teacher's patrons; among people in
moderate circumstances she will receive moderate pay, while the rich
will very often give twice the amount for the same service. The ability
and reputation of the teacher will have much to do with her earnings.</p>

<p>To become a thoroughly competent music teacher will take three or four
years' instruction. It is said that a good musical education can be
obtained as well on this as on the other side of the water. Many of the
foreign music teachers in this country are as good as can be obtained
abroad, and the European instructors, some critics say, do not give as
much time and attention to pupils as the American tutors.</p>

<hr>

<p>If a woman has a thorough knowledge of short-hand, she can do well, as a
teacher of the art, in almost any community. Many persons, even in
remote and small places, would learn phonography if the subject were
brought to their attention by an instructor. Clergymen, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page122"></a>[p.122]</span>
lawyers, doctors, many women of leisure, young women who would study
with a view to being amanuenses&mdash;all such people could be obtained as
pupils. The teacher could give from fifteen to thirty or forty lessons,
at a charge of from fifty cents to a dollar a lesson. A great many
learners of this art prefer to have a teacher's help, though phonography
can be mastered without such aid.</p>

<hr>

<p>Teachers of the art of decoration&mdash;the ornamentation of China screens,
plaques, panels, etc.&mdash;and drawing, receive from $400 to $2,000 a year.
A course of two or three years' study will fit a properly talented woman
to be an art teacher. There is a fair demand for such teachers in the
large schools and academies throughout the country.</p>

<h2 class="bl"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page123"></a>[p.123]</span> BRIEF NOTES</h2>

<blockquote>ON MARKET GARDENING, POULTRY-RAISING, BEE-KEEPING, HOUSE-KEEPERS,
CASHIERS, BUTTON-HOLE MAKING, FLORICULTURE, AUTHORSHIP,
TYPE-WRITING, AND WORKING IN BRASS.</blockquote>

<p>It would be impossible, within the limits of this little book, to go
into the details of all the employments suitable for women; only the
most important and best paying kinds of work have been mentioned in
detail. Some brief notes are here given of various occupations in which
females are now engaged, and in which they are meeting with more or less
success.</p>

<p><b>Market Gardening.</b>&mdash;Some women make money by raising vegetables for the
city markets. The produce is sometimes sent by rail, but, as a rule, it
is brought in by trucks. This industry is not, as many might suppose,
confined entirely to foreigners. There are thousands <span class="pagenum"><a id="page124"></a>[p.124]</span> of
American-born women throughout the country who are engaged in it, and
who are doing well. Mention is made of a woman who, starting with a
capital of $25, made a good living in this way, cultivating only an acre
of ground. Her husband plowed and prepared the ground, and in her part
of the work she had the assistance of the younger boys and the older
girls. During the past year she made more money than her husband did
from his farm. A woman could not expect to be successful in this
occupation unless she was unusually strong and healthy, and had the
taste for agricultural work very largely developed. Those who are born
and brought up in the country do the best.</p>

<p>The raising of <b>poultry</b> for the large city markets is a lucrative
occupation, or rather it can be made so, after a time, if the
poultry-raiser gradually increases her stock of fowls. Even if she does
not care to do this she can be pretty sure of a fair living. About $300
would be required <span class="pagenum"><a id="page125"></a>[p.125]</span> to start in this business&mdash;$100 for the
fowls, and the balance for the erection of appropriate buildings for the
animals.</p>

<p><b>Bee-keeping.</b>&mdash;There is always a good market for honey, and those who
understand the art of raising bees can be sure of making a fair living.
Women can do just as well as men, and many ladies are very successful.
It would be necessary to start with not less than thirty swarms of bees,
at a cost of from $5 to $15 a swarm, or hive. If the business is
properly followed, it will increase in a very short time, as the
colonies multiply rapidly. There are excellent books showing how this
business can be carried on, but the theoretical knowledge gained from
them must be supplemented by practical knowledge gained from experience.</p>

<p><b>House-keepers.</b>&mdash;The demand for house-keepers is very small; that is to
say, there is very little chance for a strange woman to obtain a
position of that kind. There are plenty of house-keepers, but when one
is wanted she is generally found <span class="pagenum"><a id="page126"></a>[p.126]</span> in the person of a poor
relation or struggling friend within the immediate social precinct of
the family who desire her services. Such positions, however, when they
can be obtained in the large cities, are looked upon as unusually good.
House-keepers are employed by widowers to take entire charge of a house
and look after the children, if there are any; by husbands with sick and
delicate wives; or by couples who are wealthy enough to engage such
service. They are paid from $30 to $100 per month, the salary depending
on the duties they are expected to perform, and the wealth of the
parties who employ them.</p>

<p>A house-keeper in a large hotel occupies a responsible position. She
must possess that rare feminine virtue&mdash;the ability to "get along" with
servants. The occupation is very confining, and such workers can very
seldom get, at one time, many hours' recess from their work. Their wages
run from $20 to $60 a month and their board; the larger the hotel, the
more responsible the position and the greater the pay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page127"></a>[p.127]</span> <b>Cashiers in Hotels.</b>&mdash;It requires a great deal of "influence" to
get the position of cashier in a hotel; it is a situation that is very
much coveted. As the cashier is employed in the restaurant, it is only
in hotels that are conducted on "the European plan" where such services
are required. In such hotels the guests pay so much for their room, and
get their meals where they please, paying at the time for what they get.
As a rule, they patronize the restaurant connected with the hotel. The
cashier has to work long hours. For instance: one day she will be on
duty from 8 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> until 8 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> The next day from 7 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> until 10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>;
then a recess until 5 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, then on duty until 12, midnight. She
receives her board and a salary of from $12 to $25 a month. The board is
always good. In the best hotels the cashier is allowed to order what she
pleases from the regular bill of fare; other hotels have a special bill
for the "officers" (as the better class of help are called), and from
this the selection of food has to be made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page128"></a>[p.128]</span> <b>Button-holes.</b>&mdash;Ladies do not need to be told that the
button-holes in fine dresses are made by hand. This kind of work has
become a separate business, although there are some seamstresses who
combine the making of button-holes with their regular sewing.
Dress-makers who employ twenty-five or thirty needlewomen usually keep
one button-hole maker, paying her from $9 to $12 a week; very few pay
the latter price. Some women who work at this trade prefer to be paid by
the piece. In this case they are paid at the rate of two cents and a
half per button-hole. A good worker can make fifty button-holes in a
day, and earn $1.25. It would be a very smart woman who could make
eighty, and earn $2 a day. One trouble about working by the piece is
that the woman very often has to wait until the work is got ready for
her. As she is obliged to attend on several customers during the day she
often suffers from this loss of time, sometimes losing a customer
through the failure <span class="pagenum"><a id="page129"></a>[p.129]</span> to keep an appointment, or being obliged
to do a part of her work at night.</p>

<p>The button-holes in white vests are done by hand. The pay is one cent a
button-hole, and a woman can make $1 or $1.25 a day. The work is always
done during the winter months, there is plenty of it to do, and never
any time lost in waiting.</p>

<p><b>Florists.</b>&mdash;There are eight or ten ladies in New York and Brooklyn who
have charge of floral establishments. Most of them assist their
husbands; some are widows who have inherited the business. There is one
lady in Brooklyn who has built up a good business solely through her own
efforts. This is a very good occupation for women who love flowers, who
have good taste, an eye for color and the necessary executive ability to
carry on a business by themselves. Most of the florists in New York and
Brooklyn get their plants and flowers at wholesale from nurseries on the
outskirts, purchasing such stock as they may require from <span class="pagenum"><a id="page130"></a>[p.130]</span> time
to time. Land is so valuable in the city that florists have long since
been compelled to give up the cultivation of flowers; besides, the
streets in the central and business parts are so built up, both in New
York and Brooklyn, that the ground cannot be obtained at any price. Now,
they have small stores where they make a display of "samples" of the
different varieties of flowers.</p>

<p>The work is hard at times, the florist being obliged to remain up the
best part of the night to fill an order, given at the last moment, for
funeral or wedding pieces. The decorating of churches, halls, etc., is
tiresome work, especially where palms are used, and where it is
necessary to climb up and down ladders. The keeping of plants in pots in
the store requires a good deal of labor. Many women call and want to see
what the florist has got. She has to raise up the pots of plants many
times a day, and this is very tiresome to the wrists.</p>

<p>The amount of capital required to start the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page131"></a>[p.131]</span> florist's business
is nothing like as much as it was before the large nurseries supplied
the florists with what they wanted at wholesale rates. The sum would
probably range from $200 to $1000, depending on the location, the style
in which the store was fitted up, and the amount of rent that had to be
paid. The profits are good, but vary, depending on the class of custom
the florist obtains; twenty-five per cent. is considered a fair profit.</p>

<p>The lady florist would not, probably, care to devote much time to potted
plants. She could keep a few of the more common varieties, which would
be sufficient. Most of her business&mdash;and the best paying part of her
business&mdash;would consist in making bouquets, and selling cut flowers.
That is more profitable and pleasant than the selling and propagation of
plants, and would require much less manual labor. Florists keep informed
about their occupation by carefully reading the catalogues issued by the
various large wholesale dealers, in this country, and in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page132"></a>[p.132]</span>
Europe, and the interesting and valuable books on Floriculture that are
issued from time to time.</p>

<p>To establish a regular greenhouse, and raise plants and flowers for both
the wholesale and retail trade, would require at least $5,000. A woman
to carry on the business in that way would have to be possessed of a
great deal of executive ability, give her whole personal attention to
the work, and be able to manage a considerable number of men.</p>

<p>The business is better in the smaller cities than in either New York or
Brooklyn. In Schenectady, it may be mentioned by way of illustration
that, six years ago, there were no florists; now there are three.</p>

<p><b>Authorship.</b>&mdash;Authorship has now become, very largely, a matter-of-fact
business conducted on business principles. If any woman has any thing to
say that is worth listening to she will have no trouble in securing a
publisher to reproduce her thoughts in book form. The idea <span class="pagenum"><a id="page133"></a>[p.133]</span>
that publishers strive to crush budding genius has long since been
exploded. If they were guilty of doing that very often their occupation
would be gone.</p>

<p>The woman who has a manuscript to offer for publication should first see
that it is written plainly on one side of the paper. Then she should
select a publisher who issues books of the same general character as the
one she has written. Some publishers make a specialty of light summer
novels, some of society stories, some of scientific books, and so on.
The manuscript is read by a "reader," who passes judgment upon it. If
his opinion is favorable the publisher reads the manuscript and decides
whether he will undertake to publish it.</p>

<p>The book may be bought for a certain sum outright. Or, a certain amount
may be paid on publication, and an additional sum after the book has
attained a stated circulation; or, a royalty of ten per cent. on what
will be the retail price of the book may be given; or, the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page134"></a>[p.134]</span>
author may pay for the cost of manufacturing the book, owning the
copyright, the plates, and the books printed, and paying the publisher
ten per cent. for taking charge of the publication and sale of the book.</p>

<p>Contributions for the daily and the weekly literary papers are paid for
at the rate of from $6 to $10 per one thousand words. Many young women
are ambitious to write for the story papers. There is but little chance
of success in this direction. Nearly all of the story papers have a
regular corps of contributors, who often write under several different
names, and who are paid a salary, or so much for each "instalment" of a
continued story. A publisher, however, will always buy a "sensational"
continued story if it is very good, and the fact that the author is
unknown will not count against its acceptance. A continued story should
contain not less than eight, nor more than thirteen, instalments of
about four thousand words each. The pay for such a contribution would be
from <span class="pagenum"><a id="page135"></a>[p.135]</span> $10 to $20 an instalment. There is a greater demand for
short stories for the story papers, stories containing from two to four
thousand words. The price paid for such tales would be $5 or $10.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p><b>Type-writing.</b>&mdash;Young women in the large cities do well working on the
type-writer. A girl with a good common-school education, who is
naturally bright, and quick with her fingers, can learn in four months'
time to work on the type-writer. In eight months she ought to be an
expert at the business. Some pupils might be required to practise a
year, or a year and a half, before they were thoroughly competent. Forty
words a minute is considered a good average rate of speed. Salaries of
lady type-writers in law, newspaper, and mercantile offices range from
$10 to $20 a week. A woman would have to be a very expert type-writer,
or <span class="pagenum"><a id="page136"></a>[p.136]</span> have joined with the knowledge of type-writing some
knowledge of short-hand, to earn $20 a week. In railroad offices
type-writers are paid $60 a month. Type-writing offices, where
type-writing is done for the public by the job, and where this kind of
help is employed, pay $10 and $12 a week.</p>

<p>Some women open offices and depend on job work. They receive five cents
a folio (one hundred words) for furnishing one copy of a manuscript,
eight cents a folio for two, and ten cents a folio for three copies.
Some charge ten cents per page (three hundred words) for furnishing one
copy, twelve cents for furnishing two copies, and fifteen cents for
furnishing three copies. Several copies of a page can be taken at one
time on the type-writer. This is an excellent industry for women. No
special talent is required, except that a woman should be a good speller
and have a fair knowledge of the rules of punctuation. A new telegraph
company that has just been started is, it is said, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page137"></a>[p.137]</span> going to
employ lady type-writers in many of its offices to take down the
messages as they are received by the operators. This of itself will
create a great demand for lady type-writers.</p>

<p><b>Wood-Engraving.</b>&mdash;It requires four or five years' study for a woman to
become competent in wood-engraving. After three years of hard work she
may hope to do some ordinary engraving for which she will receive
compensation. In the Cooper Institute (New York), where the art is
taught to women, the course of instruction covers four years. The pupils
work every day from 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> to 5 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> the year round, obtaining
theoretical instruction from a teacher twice a week.</p>

<p>For engraving a block a trifle larger than this page a woman will
receive $50. It will take her from three to five weeks to do the work,
depending on the amount of experience she has had in the business. Some
women occupy themselves on "catalogue work," <i>i. e.</i>, engraving the
illustrations for mercantile books and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page138"></a>[p.138]</span> agricultural
catalogues. At this branch of work they can make from $20 to $25 a week.
There are very few female wood-engravers at present. To women who have
the necessary talent, and who can afford to give the requisite amount of
time to the study of the art, wood-engraving will furnish a sure means
of making a living.</p>

<p><b>Working in Brass.</b>&mdash;This is a new occupation for women that is being
taught in one of the technical schools in New York. A few women are
successfully doing some work in the business and receiving fair pay. A
lady who has a good knowledge of drawing can, it is said, after a course
of twelve lessons do marketable work. Pupils who are able to make
original designs do the best. A course of twelve lessons in the school
alluded to costs $10. The work is by the piece, and is paid for
according to the style of the pattern. For small leaves the pay is from
60 to 70 cents each; leaves six inches in length $1 each; a panel 10 × 6
inches, $4 to $5, according to pattern. Tiles are popular and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page139"></a>[p.139]</span>
well paid for. The work is very well suited for a woman, and her
earnings ought to run from $10 to $25 a week, depending altogether on
her talent. After taking lessons and learning the theoretical part of
the business it would be well for a woman to go, for a short time, into
some establishment where brass-work is done. There she would probably
get some practical hints that would be of great service.</p>
